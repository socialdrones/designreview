# Tactility Perception

*To what degree do participants perceive the drone design under investigation as something they can touch or hold?*

- Current commercial drones do not appear to be as agile, responsive, and effective as a human partner in functioning as an intensive training and practice aid for boxing.
- Users do enjoy the concept of a drone as an exercise aid, and interaction designs involving drones could be used for exercises in which no or minimum impact is required.

2. [Drone Near Me: Exploring Touch-Based Human-Drone Interaction](2017_Abtahi_DroneNearMe.md) by Parastoo Abtahi, David Y. Zhao, Jane L. E, and James A. Landay in *IMWUT*
- In safe-to-touch condition, 58% of participants touched the drone and 39% of all interactions were touch-based.
- Interacting with the safe-to-touch drone was reported to be significantly less mentally demanding than the unsafe drone.
- Majority of users (83%) reported that they felt safe while interacting with it.

### 2018
3. [Flyables: Exploring 3D Interaction Spaces for Levitating Tangibles](2018_Knierim_Flyables.md) by Pascal Knierim, Alexander Achberger, Thomas Kosch, and Markus Funk in *TEI*
- All participants used their whole hand during drag interactions.
- For drag interactions, use the defined interaction space for standing users (The interaction space has a median height of 93 cm to 189 cm above the ground and a width of 109 cm).
- Tangible should idle at an altitude between elbow and breast (140 cm) to enable a comfortable use.
- The haptic feedback should be sufficient for draw output modality.
- The size of the cage should consist of a size between 10 cm×10 cm and 12 cm×12 cm.
- Quadcopter frames should enclose levitating tangibles.
