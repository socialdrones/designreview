# Tactility Perception

*To what degree do participants perceive the drone design under investigation as something they can touch or hold?*

# Summary Analysis

Even though airborne tangible UIs appear to hold much future potential for novel interaction designs, studies agree that potential users rarely recognize propeller-driven drones as providing safe and stable touch affordances in early encounters; however, as quick as during the progression of a single user study, participants have been observed to adapt well to the concept - provided, understandably, that the moving parts are appropriately enclosed in protective exteriors. 

While we have not come across a dedicated study on the effect of drone size on the perception of tactile affordances, that greater aversion to touching a drone has been observed in studies with a larger drone. Specifically, studies using compact prototypes with a greatest dimension of 12cm have yielded favorable results, in contrast to earlier studies with full-size drones. Finally, more favorable results with tactile affordances have been reported in the context of sports and exercise, where presumably participants felt prepared to respond reflexively to unexpected drone behavior.

- Current commercial drones do not appear to be as agile, responsive, and effective as a human partner in functioning as an intensive training and practice aid for boxing.
- Users do enjoy the concept of a drone as an exercise aid, and interaction designs involving drones could be used for exercises in which no or minimum impact is required.

- In safe-to-touch condition, 58% of participants touched the drone and 39% of all interactions were touch-based.
- Interacting with the safe-to-touch drone was reported to be significantly less mentally demanding than the unsafe drone.
- Majority of users (83%) reported that they felt safe while interacting with it.

- All participants used their whole hand during drag interactions.
- For drag interactions, use the defined interaction space for standing users (The interaction space has a median height of 93 cm to 189 cm above the ground and a width of 109 cm).
- Tangible should idle at an altitude between elbow and breast (140 cm) to enable a comfortable use.
- The haptic feedback should be sufficient for draw output modality.
- The size of the cage should consist of a size between 10 cm×10 cm and 12 cm×12 cm.
- Quadcopter frames should enclose levitating tangibles.
