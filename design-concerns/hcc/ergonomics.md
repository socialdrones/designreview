# Ergonomics

Are participants physically comfortable in interacting with the drone(s) using the proposed interaction design(s)?

1. [Collocated Interaction with Flying Robots](2011_Ng_Collocated.md) by Wai Shan (Florence) Ng and Ehud Sharlin in *RO-MAN*
- Using large gestures as the sole interaction modality quickly leads to fatigue.
- Using a prop (a raquet) is not preferred, compared to free-hand gesturing.

2. [Midair Displays: Concept and First Experiences with Free-Floating Pervasive Displays](2014_Schneegass_PerDis.md) by Stefan Schneegass, Florian Alt, Jürgen Scheible, and Albrecht Schmidt in *PerDis*
- Readability is significantly worse when participant is walking.
- No significant difference between readability in stationary, hovering, flying conditions.
- Use cases should not involve moving user, but drone could move

3. [Midair Displays: Exploring the Concept of Free-Floating Public Displays](2014_Schneegass_Exploring.md) by Stefan Schneegass, Florian Alt, Jürgen Scheible, Albrecht Schmidt, and Heifeng Su in *CHI EA*
- Mid-air Displays are Preferred while walking, standing, swimming; not while biking, driving
- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed

4. [Drone & Me: An Exploration Into Natural Human-Drone Interaction](2015_Cauchard_DroneAndMe.md) by Jessica R. Cauchard, Jane L. E, Kevin Y. Zhai, and James A. Landay in *UbiComp*
- Feelings of naturalness, safety, perceived control over the drone were rated highly, while the interactions were not considered to be physical and mentaly demanding.
- Repeated waving/sweeping was preferred for navigating the drone when far from the body, while smaller motions with body parts as reference were preferred within body range.
- Noise and airflow around the drone led to discomfort.

5. [Jogging with a Quadcopter](2015_Mueller_Jogging.md) by Florian 'Floyd' Mueller and Matthew Muirhead in *CHI*
- Quadcopter draws attention: Distraction from the discomfort of exercise.

6. [Exploring the Use of a Drone to Guide Blind Runners](2016_AlZayer_Runners.md) by Majed Al-Zayer, Sam Tregillus, Jiwan Bhandari, Dave Feil-Seifer, and Eelke Folmer in *ASSETS*
- It may be feasible to use drones for tasks involving localization and nagivation at a slow pace, by the sound of the drone alone, without relying on sight.
- At a high pace, when running or undertaking physical exercise of intensity, it is not feasible to expect people to follow or localize a drone by sound alone, without sight.

7. [Elevating Communication, Collaboration, and Shared Experiences in Mobile Video through Drones](2016_Jones_MobileVideo.md) by Brennan Jones, Kody Dillman, Richard Tang, Anthony Tang, Ehud Sharlin, Lora Oehlberg, Carman Neustaedter, and Scott Bateman in *DIS*
- FPs were genrally comfortable around the drone, but some reported discomfort with propeller noise.

8. [How Would You Gesture Navigate a Drone? A User-Centered Approach to Control a Drone](2016_Obaid_Gesture.md) by Mohammad Obaid, Felix Kistler, Gabriele Kasparaviciute, Asım Evren Yantaç, and Morten Fjeld in *Academic Mindtrek*
- Dynamic" gestures were preferred over "static" ones for almost all commands.
- Gestures of a "deictic" nature were often preferred for navigational commands, while "emblematic" and "metaphoric" gestures were preferred for "take picture" and "record video" commands.

9. [A Non-grounded and Encountered-type Haptic Display Using a Drone](2016_Yamaguchi_HapticDisplay.md) by Kotaro Yamaguchi, Ginga Kato, Yoshihiro Kuroda, Kiyoshi Kiyokawa, and Haruo Takemura in *SUI*
- The haptic display was helpful (in a statistically significant manner) in assisting users to draw a straight line mid-air.
- Drones have potential in being used for implementations of haptic feedback mechanisms for virtual reality, with advantages over static/grounded haptic feedback mechanisms.

10. [Boxing against drones: Drones in sports education](2016_Zwaan_Boxing.md) by Sergej G. Zwaan and Emilia I. Barakova in *IDC*
- The drone was perceived to be slower and less dynamic than a human sparring partner, which decreased the intensity of exercise.

11. 1. [Drone Near Me: Exploring Touch-Based Human-Drone Interaction](2017_Abtahi_DroneNearMe.md) by Parastoo Abtahi, David Y. Zhao, Jane L. E, and James A. Landay in *IMWUT*
- Participants in the safe-to-touch condition used touch-based interactions significantly more and gestures significantly less. There was no significant difference in the percentage of use for sound.
- The minimum distance between the participants and the safe-to-touch drone was less than the minimum distance in the control condition. In the safe-to-touch condition all participants interacted with the drone in their intimate space (< 1. 5ft) , compared to 42% in the control condition.

12.  [DroneNavigator: Using Leashed and Free-Floating Quadcopters to Navigate Visually Impaired Travelers](2017_AvilaSoto_DroneNavigator.md) by Mauro Avila Soto, Markus Funk, Matthias Hoppe, Robin Boldt, Katrin Wolf, and Niels Henze in *ASSETS*
- Audio navigation was perceived to be inducing the least workload, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the free-flying quadcopter. However, these differences were not statistically significant.
- The quadcopter was considered advantageous since it does not encumber the user.
- Confidence in quadcopter navigation was not high, since it may be difficult to perceive it in noisy environments, and the noise became annoying to participants after a while.
- The leashed quadcopter was accepted as a precise navigation tool, but was not preferred since it encumbers both hands (one with the leash, while one is readily holding a cane).
- Despite leading to better task performance and various ergonomic advantages, acceptance of drones as a navigational aid was not higher than the technically "worse" solution (audio); due to a lack of confidence in the technology in diverse environments, noise characteristics, and concerns over social acceptance.

13. [Drone & Wo: Cultural Influences on Human-Drone Interaction Techniques](2017_Ilene_DroneWo.md) by Jane L. E, Ilene L. E, James A. Landay, and Jessica R. Cauchard in *CHI*
- Support should be designed for multi-modal interaction allowing use of slight variation in gestures, and extra contextual words.
- Chinese participants overall felt interacting with the drone was more physically demanding

14. [Investigating Drone Motion as Pedestrian Guidance](2017_Colley_InvestigatingDroneMotion.md) by Ashley Colley, Lasse Virtanen, Pascal Knierim, Jonna Häkkilä in *MUM*
- The drone’s loud noise was commented negatively by 7/10 participants.

15: [FlyMap: Interacting with Maps Projected from a Drone](2018_Brock_FlyMap.md) by Anke M. Brock, Julia Chatain, Michelle Park, Tommy Fang, Martin Hachet, James A. Landay, and Jessica R. Cauchard in *PerDis*
- Spatial technique (Drone projected map) is beneficial for spatial learning(enabled remembering more POIs correctly), but it requires significantly more physical effort (than using a mobile phone).
- The most common challenge participants had was in keeping track of the cursor position due to the jitter of the drone.

16. [GazeDrone: Mobile Eye-Based Interaction in Public Space Without Augmenting the User](2018_Khamis_GazeDrone.md) by Mohamed Khamis, Anna Kienle, Florian Alt, and Andreas Bulling in *DroNet*
- Interacting while moving parallel to the display is unnatural and demanding.
- Drone should hover with an adjustable camera angle at an altitude below the user’s height, and use small drones (3 x 3 x 2 cm).

17. [Flyables: Exploring 3D Interaction Spaces for Levitating Tangibles](2018_Knierim_Flyables.md) by Pascal Knierim, Alexander Achberger, Thomas Kosch, and Markus Funk in *TEI*
- No significant difference between user ratings for different heights, 53% of participants liked the altitude of 140 cm most.
- All participants used their whole hand during drag interactions.
- The interaction space has a median height of 93 cm to 189 cm above the ground and a width of 109 cm. Participants dragged the tangible in average 5 cm further to the right than left. The median forward movement is 50 cm.
- Drawbacks: Noise, battery life, weak drag (during drag interaction).
- For drag interactions, use the defined interaction space for standing users.
- Tangible should idle at an altitude between elbow and breast (140 cm) to enable a comfortable use.
- The haptic feedback should be sufficient for draw output modality.
- The size of the cage should consist of a size between 10 cm×10 cm and 12 cm×12 cm.
- Quadcopter frames should enclose levitating tangibles.

18. [Communicating Robot Motion Intent with Augmented Reality](2018_Walker_CommunicatingRobotMotionIntent.md) Michael Walker, Hooman Hedayati, Jennifer Lee, and Daniel Szafir in *HRI*
- NavPoints, Arrow, and Gaze, were ranked as significantly more helpful than Utilities. NavPoints was rated as significantly more helpful than Gaze, with Arrow ranked marginally more helpful than Gaze.
