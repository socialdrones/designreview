# Ergonomics

*Are participants physically comfortable in interacting with the drone(s) using the proposed interaction design(s)?*

## Summary Analysis

Ergonomics in the context of interactive drones has been most relevant for gesture-based control schemes, drone-based tangibles, and in cases where users are supposed to direct their attention or whole body to follow a drone. The literature suggests various heuristics for each of these contexts.

For gesture-based control schemes, it is suggested that props can easily become cumbersome and to be avoided if possible; and large gestures quickly lead to "gorilla arm"-type exhaustion. Similarly, studies with compact flying tangibles affording "push" and "drag" interactions also report that a modest interaction space, roughly 1m in each direction, and positioned between elbow and chest height, provides for favorable ergonomics. These studies are executed with WoZ methods, and practical investigations of drone-mounted gesture recognition capabilities may be of interest for future work.

For cases where a drone is meant to be followed with the gaze, studies suggest caution against extensive movement, especially of the user. Experiments with drone-mounted displays have shown that legibility can be good when both the observer and the drone are static, and reasonable when the drone moves; but content can become illegible in cases where the user's movement exceeds a slow walking speed. Maintaining interaction with a drone-mounted eye tracker is also reported to become similarly challenging for a moving human. Conversely, such issues have not been reported with displays based on drone-mounted projection. Collectively, these findings suggest that stability of the user and the medium are both critical for drone-based displays.

Some studies, particularly for assistive technologies for the blind, experiment with of using propeller noise to localize a drone. The results here are mixed, with initial explorations producing promising results, while more rigorous studies with greater numbers of participants and more sophisticated methodology revealing drawbacks in terms of both users' confidence in the technology and its performance in noisy environments. Intentional design of both mechanical and speaker-reproduced sounds for these applications has been left for future work.

- Feelings of naturalness, safety, perceived control over the drone were rated highly, while the interactions were not considered to be physical and mentaly demanding.

- It may be feasible to use drones for tasks involving localization and nagivation at a slow pace, by the sound of the drone alone, without relying on sight.
- At a high pace, when running or undertaking physical exercise of intensity, it is not feasible to expect people to follow or localize a drone by sound alone, without sight.

- Dynamic" gestures were preferred over "static" ones for almost all commands.
- Gestures of a "deictic" nature were often preferred for navigational commands, while "emblematic" and "metaphoric" gestures were preferred for "take picture" and "record video" commands.

- The haptic display was helpful (in a statistically significant manner) in assisting users to draw a straight line mid-air.
- Drones have potential in being used for implementations of haptic feedback mechanisms for virtual reality, with advantages over static/grounded haptic feedback mechanisms.

[Boxing against drones: Drones in sports education](2016_Zwaan_Boxing.md) by Sergej G. Zwaan and Emilia I. Barakova in *IDC*

- The drone was perceived to be slower and less dynamic than a human sparring partner, which decreased the intensity of exercise.

- Participants in the safe-to-touch condition used touch-based interactions significantly more and gestures significantly less. There was no significant difference in the percentage of use for sound.
- The minimum distance between the participants and the safe-to-touch drone was less than the minimum distance in the control condition. In the safe-to-touch condition all participants interacted with the drone in their intimate space (< 1. 5ft) , compared to 42% in the control condition.

[DroneNavigator: Using Leashed and Free-Floating Quadcopters to Navigate Visually Impaired Travelers](2017_AvilaSoto_DroneNavigator.md) by Mauro Avila Soto, Markus Funk, Matthias Hoppe, Robin Boldt, Katrin Wolf, and Niels Henze in *ASSETS*

- Audio navigation was perceived to be inducing the least workload, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the free-flying quadcopter. However, these differences were not statistically significant.
- The quadcopter was considered advantageous since it does not encumber the user.
- Confidence in quadcopter navigation was not high, since it may be difficult to perceive it in noisy environments, and the noise became annoying to participants after a while.
- The leashed quadcopter was accepted as a precise navigation tool, but was not preferred since it encumbers both hands (one with the leash, while one is readily holding a cane).
- Despite leading to better task performance and various ergonomic advantages, acceptance of drones as a navigational aid was not higher than the technically "worse" solution (audio); due to a lack of confidence in the technology in diverse environments, noise characteristics, and concerns over social acceptance.

[Flyables: Exploring 3D Interaction Spaces for Levitating Tangibles](2018_Knierim_Flyables.md) by Pascal Knierim, Alexander Achberger, Thomas Kosch, and Markus Funk in *TEI*

- No significant difference between user ratings for different heights, 53% of participants liked the altitude of 140 cm most.
- All participants used their whole hand during drag interactions.
- The interaction space has a median height of 93 cm to 189 cm above the ground and a width of 109 cm. Participants dragged the tangible in average 5 cm further to the right than left. The median forward movement is 50 cm.
- Drawbacks: Noise, battery life, weak drag (during drag interaction).
- For drag interactions, use the defined interaction space for standing users.
- Tangible should idle at an altitude between elbow and breast (140 cm) to enable a comfortable use.
- The haptic feedback should be sufficient for draw output modality.
- The size of the cage should consist of a size between 10 cm×10 cm and 12 cm×12 cm.
- Quadcopter frames should enclose levitating tangibles.
