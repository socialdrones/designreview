# Appeal

* Are people willing to accept, acquire, and/or use a drone ordrones, as designed, for the purpose under investigation? Do people feel psychologically comfortable and safe ininteracting with the drone(s) or simply cohabiting thesame environment? Do they have confidence that the dronewill not inflict damage or otherwise misbehave?*

## Studies concerned with Appeal

1. [Collocated Interaction with Flying Robots](2011_Ng_Collocated.md) by Wai Shan (Florence) Ng and Ehud Sharlin in *RO-MAN*

2. [Displaydrone: A Flying Robot Based Interactive Display](2013_Scheible_Displaydrone.md) by Jürgen Scheible, Achin Hoth, Julian Saal, and Haifeng Su in *PerDis*

- Over half of our participants (11/20) were concerned with damage and interference with air traffic.
- All of the participants’ were concerned about drones disturbing nature.
- Geo-fencing could be used to prevent drones from getting too close to places such as schools, government buildings, landmarks, or wildlife areas.
- One possibility for future work would be to explore how drones could operate in designated spaces or drone “highways”.
- Drone designs should explore the use of non-visual cues and recording feedback to enhance users’ privacy and security.
- We suggest that drone designers carefully consider the use of colors, logos, and decorations to make drones “friendly”, or “unfriendly” in cases where it is necessary for people to keep their distance from certain drones.
- Drone sizes could be balanced to ensure that they are not perceived as too stealthy or concealing dangerous items.
- To help protect wildlife, we also suggest that drones could be designed with visual or audio animal repellents.
