# Perceived Social Role

*What kinds of existing conventions — e.g. privileges, responsibilities, expectations — around social roles assigned to living beings are relevant for drone behavior?*

1. [Collocated Interaction with Flying Robots](2011_Ng_Collocated.md) by Wai Shan (Florence) Ng and Ehud Sharlin in *RO-MAN*

- Using gestures to control a drone can be used to induce attachment / socialization, as if it were a pet

2. [Emotion Encoding in Human-Drone Interaction](2016_Cauchard_EmotionEncoding.md) by Jessica R. Cauchard, Kevin Y. Zhai, Marco Spadafora, and James A. Landay in *HRI*

- Human interpretations of drone behavior are often based on expectations formed by animal behavior.

3. [The Naughty Drone: A Qualitative Research on Drone as Companion Device](2016_Kim_Naughty.md) by Hyun Young Kim, Bomyeong Kim, and Jinwoo Kim in *IMCOM*

- The drone was envisioned in various social roles, clustered as "servant," "pet," "friend," and "bully;" which varied (in a decreasing fashion, respectively) on a principal design dimension identified as "perceived controllability." Participants were more appealed to by a drone that has the ability to fulfill multiple roles, rather than one; but higher preference was expressed for roles with higher perceived controllability.

- Participants expressed preference towards an ability to "train" the drone (e.g. as one would a pet), rather than having direct control over it.

4. [Social Drone Companion for the Home Environment: a User-Centric Exploration](2017_Karjalainen_SocialDroneCompanion.md) by Kari Daniel Karjalainen, Anna Elisabeth Sofia Romell , Photchara Ratsamee, Asım Evren Yantac, Morten Fjeld, and Mohammad Obaid in *HAI*

- Preferred social role of the drone is as an assistant, butler, toy and device/computer.

5. [Human-Drone Interaction: Drone Delivery & Services for Social Events](2018_Tan_Human-DroneInteraction.md) by Haodan Tan, Jangwon Lee, and Gege Gao in *DIS*

- Participants made interpretations of social roles regarding drone’s appearance and behavior.
- Try to generate a friendlier appearance for drone.

6. [Communicating Robot Motion Intent with Augmented Reality](2018_Walker_CommunicatingRobotMotionIntent.md) Michael Walker, Hooman Hedayati, Jennifer Lee, and Daniel Szafir in *HRI*

- NavPoints was the only design to significantly improve perceptions of the robot as a personal work partner and as a work partner for others over the baseline.
