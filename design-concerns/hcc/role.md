# Perceived Social Role

*What kinds of existing conventions — e.g. privileges, responsibilities, expectations — around social roles assigned to living beings are relevant for drone behavior?*

## Summary Analysis

While a diverse array of task- and context-based functions and roles for drones have been explored, studies most commonly suggest that people are inclined to and comfortable with using a "pet" metaphor for interacting with drones. Qualitative findings support the "pet" metaphor from many angles. For example, human interpretations of drone behavior have been reported to be often based on expectations formed by animal behavior; gesture- and voice-based interactions with drones have been observed to induce, over the course of studies, attachment and socialization as if towards a pet; and the capability to "train" a drone like a pet has been preferred over direct and absolute control. The strength of how much this metaphor influences user sentiment and behavior may vary based on cultural factors, but findings converge over the existence of such influence. This evidence points to opportunities for future work around transferring knowledge from animal cognition and behavior, as well as human-animal interactions and animal training, to drone design.

- The drone was envisioned in various social roles, clustered as "servant," "pet," "friend," and "bully;" which varied (in a decreasing fashion, respectively) on a principal design dimension identified as "perceived controllability." Participants were more appealed to by a drone that has the ability to fulfill multiple roles, rather than one; but higher preference was expressed for roles with higher perceived controllability.
- Participants expressed preference towards an ability to "train" the drone (e.g. as one would a pet), rather than having direct control over it.
