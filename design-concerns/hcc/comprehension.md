# Intuitive Comprehension

*To what degree are participants able to interpret intentions or messages that the drone is trying to convey via the interaction design under investigation, without extensive documentation or explanation?*

[Daedalus: A sUAV for Human-Robot Interaction](2014_Arroyo_Daedalus.md) by Dante Arroyo, Cesar Lucho, Julissa Roncal, and Francisco Cuellar in *HRI*

- Movements without propeller noise tended to generate positive emotions, while movements with operating propellers evoked the opposite.
- Human-robot interaction can be improved by giving the robot the faculty to perform different emotional states through a communication interface.
- Subjects were not always consistent for each interpretation that comprehended head movements and eye color.

[Communication of Intent in Assistive Free Flyers](2014_Szafir_Intent.md) by Daniel Szafir, Bilge Mutlu, and Terrence Fong in *HRI*

- Smooth velocities may be particularly important when closely interacting with users, for intuitive comprehension of drone intent.
- Arcing may effectively signal that an AFF will not approach or collide with a user or other objects, hance inspiring a perception of safety and stability / being in control.
- Intentful design of flight motions is effective in inspiring positive user sentiment towards using and being with a drone.

[A Drone Agent to Support a Clean Environment](2015_Obaid_Environment.md) by Mohammad Obaid, Omar Mubin, Christina Anne Basedow, A. Ayça Ünlüer, Matz Johansson Bergström, and Morten Fjeld in *HAI*

- The audio+visual design was rated to be significantly more "sensible" than the audio-only design.
- Colors in the visual feedback were suggested by participants as a design dimension.
- Mutimodal interaction (audio+visual) with a drone was found to be more effective and "sensible" than audio-only and visual-only modalities.

[Communicating Directionality in Flying Robots](2015_Szafir_CommunicatingDirectionality.md) by Daniel Szafir, Bilge Mutlu, and Terry Fong in *HRI*

- Users differentiated the signal designs from baseline behavior in terms of telegraphing intent and believed that the use of gaze, thruster, blinker, and beacon behaviors improved robot predictability over baseline flight behaviors.
- In terms of clarity, post-hoc tests found all individual designs to be rated significantly higher than the baseline
- There was a significant difference between the blinker design, rated as highly intuitive, and the thruster design, which participants found to be less intuitive.
- While gaze, thruster, and blinker significantly improved participant confidence in understanding robot communication over the baseline, participants felt only marginally more confident when the robot used the beacon signals.
- Users preferred signal specificity at the cost of generalizability and overall found gaze behaviors to be highly useful in improving flyer abilities to communicate and collaborate effectively.
- User responses support the notion that visual cues should convey high level aspects of flight intentions rather than low level corrections to flight paths.

[Emotion Encoding in Human-Drone Interaction](2016_Cauchard_EmotionEncoding.md) by Jessica R. Cauchard, Kevin Y. Zhai, Marco Spadafora, and James A. Landay in *HRI*

- While the "adventurer/hero" (happy, brave) model was well-identified, the "exhausted" (dopey, sad, sleepy) and "anti-social" (grumpy, shy) models were not accurately identified by participants.
- When allowing for a "second guess," identification rates for all three models were high.
- Participants often correctly identified the task or action that the drone was undertaking, but identification of its emotional state (on the first guess) was more challenging.
- Flight parameters such as flight path, reaction time, altitute, orientation, and speed; as well as reactivity/compliance, are effective in establishing intuitively comprehensible drone behaviors.

[Action Elements of Emotional Body Expressions for Flying Robots](2016_Hieida_ActionElements.md) by Chie Hieida, Hiroaki Matsuda, Shunsuke Kudoh, and Takashi Suehiro in *HRI*

- Sentiments of pleasure–displeasure and arousal–sleepy can be conveyed through movements in the "gravitational" direction.
- Sentiments of powerful–delicate, pinpointing–flexible, and hasty–leisurely can be conveyed through movements in both "gravitational" and "personal" directions.

[Boxing against drones: Drones in sports education](2016_Zwaan_Boxing.md) by Sergej G. Zwaan and Emilia I. Barakova in *IDC*

- The drone was perceived to be slower and less dynamic than a human sparring partner, which decreased the intensity of exercise.
- Current commercial drones do not appear to be as agile, responsive, and effective as a human partner in functioning as an intensive training and practice aid for boxing.

[DroneNavigator: Using Leashed and Free-Floating Quadcopters to Navigate Visually Impaired Travelers](2017_AvilaSoto_DroneNavigator.md) by Mauro Avila Soto, Markus Funk, Matthias Hoppe, Robin Boldt, Katrin Wolf, and Niels Henze in *ASSETS*

- Task completion time was fastest with the free-flying quadcopter, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the audio. Task completion time with the free-flying quadcopter was significantly faster than with the audio navigation.
- Audio navigation led to the most navigation errors, followed by the free-flying quadcopter. The leashed quadcopter led to the least errors. Differences were statistically signifiant.
- Audio navigation was perceived to be inducing the least workload, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the free-flying quadcopter. However, these differences were not statistically significant.
- Most participants preferred to use audio navigation, followed by the free-flying drone, then the leashed drone.
- The quadcopter was considered advantageous since it does not encumber the user.
- Confidence in quadcopter navigation was not high, since it may be difficult to perceive it in noisy environments, and the noise became annoying to participants after a while.
- The leashed quadcopter was accepted as a precise navigation tool, but was not preferred since it encumbers both hands (one with the leash, while one is readily holding a cane).
- Despite leading to better task performance and various ergonomic advantages, acceptance of drones as a navigational aid was not higher than the technically "worse" solution (audio); due to a lack of confidence in the technology in diverse environments, noise characteristics, and concerns over social acceptance.

[Investigating Drone Motion as Pedestrian Guidance](2017_Colley_InvestigatingDroneMotion.md) by Ashley Colley, Lasse Virtanen, Pascal Knierim, Jonna Häkkilä in *MUM*

- Constant moving drone (A) was preferred, with 77% of participants commenting on the positive side for its clarity and 75% for its practicality.
- Participants rated the drone flying across the street and waiting (C) highest in terms of practicality and clarity.
- The turn a corner (B) gesture was universally understood.
- When the drone tilted strongly left several times all participants understood it meant turn left.
- Participants had different interpretations for the turn a corner (C) gesture, where the drone rotated clockwise around its vertical axis.
- The straight-ahead gestures were both understood by all participants, but with some difference in interpretation.
- When the drone maintained a short distance in front of the pedestrian, 9/10 participant understood it as “follow me mode”.
- The straight ahead (C) gesture, which 8/10 understood to mean “Go faster”, made some participants feel unsafe (3/10) or lacking control (3/10).
- The cross a road (C) gesture, was almost universally misunderstood.
- Participants’ preferred distance from the drone, ascertained by flying the drone according to the participants’ wishes, was 4.0 m. Preferred flying height for the drone was 2.6 m (SD = 0.8 m).
- For straight ahead navigation, the drone should maintain a distance of approximately 3 - 4 m in front of the pedestrian and move at normal walking speed.
- For indicating the need to turn a corner, both studies delivered a strong preference for a tilting gesture, rapidly towards the direction of the turn and returning more slowly to horizontal.
- Drone motion for cases where the drone is required, e.g. due to environmental circumstances, to move further away from the pedestrian was found to be challenging gestures for such cases will require further study.

[Knowing You, Seeing Me: Investigating User Preferences in Drone-Human Acknowledgement](2018_Jensen_KnowingYouSeeingMe.md) by Walther Jensen, Simon Hansen, and Hendrik Knoche in *CHI*

- There is a significant difference for the gesture with large effect size, on the feeling of being acknowledged.
- Participants had little difficulty describing and ascribing the meanings of the waggle as wobbling bobbing or winking, nod as greeting and orienting as trying to communicate. Participants struggled with the toss gesture.
- On average the online participants (66.4%) felt that the drone had acknowledged them.
- All salutations significantly increased the participants’ feeling of acknowledgment.
- The respondents had no problem describing and ascribing meaning to toss compared to nod.
- Physical designs of drones should visually emphasize the front of the drone so that users can recognize an orienting gesture.
- Gestures have to be sufficiently different from an approach or hovering posture.
- Due to external factors such as wind and sensor noise drones need to use corrective maneuvers to maintain their desired speed and orientation in terms of roll, pitch, and yaw.
- Gestures should be sufficiently different from such maneuvers
- Designers need to consider both the available space and the drone speed to use gestures in flight.
- Drones need to adapt the gestures they use and how to perform them according to wind strength and direction.
- High rotational (yaw) speeds (200°/sec) appeared as uncontrolled behavior and slow speeds (50°/sec) resulted in unresponsive flights in our implementation. We found 100°/sec suitable for orienting and employed 66°/sec for nods and tosses and 133°/sec for waggles.
- Changes in drone speeds were perceived as potentially threatening, aggressive, or erratic behavior.
- Designers should tap into other modalities for cues that can help communicate acknowledgment to make gestures more robust under adverse conditions and address the number of participants who did not feel acknowledged. Making eye contact and verbal salutations or other audible feedback all represent promising candidates.

[Aeroquake: Drone Augmented Dance](2018_Kim_Aeroquake.md) by Heesoon Kim and James A. Landay in *DIS*

- All participants were aware that the dancer’s movement affected the motion of the drones.

[Quadcopter-Projected In-Situ Navigation Cues for Improved Location Awareness](2018_Knierim_Quadcopter-ProjectedInSituNavigationCues.md) by Pascal Knierim, Steffen Maurer, Katrin Wolf, and Markus Funk in *CHI*

- Using in-situ navigation instructions while walking leads to a higher memorability of the surroundings as opposed to mobile phone navigation, but it requires more time.

[Communicating Robot Motion Intent with Augmented Reality](2018_Walker_CommunicatingRobotMotionIntent.md) Michael Walker, Hooman Hedayati, Jennifer Lee, and Daniel Szafir in *HRI*

- NavPoints design was rated significantly higher on clarity than the baseline, but there was no significant effects from the other designs.
- ARHMD technology can significantly improve user understandings of robot intent and increase objective task efficiency.
