# Design Concerns for Social Drones

Findings from [our corpus of research papers](https://github.com/socialdrones/designreview/tree/master/prospectuses) were clustered based on an emergent framework relating *drone design concerns* (DDCs) and *human-centered concerns* (HCCs), in order to consolidate and compare design knowledge created through different studies.

From the literature, we have identified 6 HCCs and 6DDCs. These were defined so that ahigh degree of orthogonality was maintained between categories, along with inclusive coverage of the design knowledge in the literature.
