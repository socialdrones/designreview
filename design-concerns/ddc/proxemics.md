[Midair Displays: Concept and First Experiences with Free-Floating Pervasive Displays](2014_Schneegass_PerDis.md) by Stefan Schneegass, Florian Alt, Jürgen Scheible, and Albrecht Schmidt in *PerDis*

- Readability is significantly worse when participant is walking
- No significant difference between readability in stationary, hovering, flying conditions
- Flight stability is not enough, causes “stress”
- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed
- Use cases should not involve moving user, but drone could move

- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed

[DroneNavigator: Using Drones for Navigating Visually Impaired Persons](2015_Avila_DroneNavigator.md) by Mauro Avila, Markus Funk, and Niels Henze in *ASSETS*

- The small drone was able to guide the blind participant precisely on paths with straight lines and turns.
- The small drone was able to guide the blind participant precisely in a populated room with its sound only, even in a populated and noisy environment.
- Drones are a feasible way to assist the visually impaired in navigation and object-finding.
- The sound of the drone's propellers itself is sufficient to locate the drone in the absence of sight, with a precision that allows for targets as small as 50cm.

[Drone & Me: An Exploration Into Natural Human-Drone Interaction](2015_Cauchard_DroneAndMe.md) by Jessica R. Cauchard, Jane L. E, Kevin Y. Zhai, and James A. Landay in *UbiComp*

- Repeated waving/sweeping was preferred for navigating the drone when far from the body, while smaller motions with body parts as reference were preferred within body range.

[Jogging with a Quadcopter](2015_Mueller_Jogging.md) by Florian 'Floyd' Mueller and Matthew Muirhead in *CHI*

- Support “Contending for Space” to facilitate movement variety
- Use robot to direct focus away from the discomfort of exercise
- Utilize, not fight the robot’s secondary movements
- Utilize the shared space to support the movement 
- Exploit mutual exertion investment

[Exploring the Use of a Drone to Guide Blind Runners](2016_AlZayer_Runners.md) by Majed Al-Zayer, Sam Tregillus, Jiwan Bhandari, Dave Feil-Seifer, and Eelke Folmer in *ASSETS*

- It may be feasible to use drones for tasks involving localization and nagivation at a slow pace, by the sound of the drone alone, without relying on sight.
- At a high pace, when running or undertaking physical exercise of intensity, it is not feasible to expect people to follow or localize a drone by sound alone, without sight.
- Results did not change when the distance between the drone and the participant was changed between 3m and 4m.

[Elevating Communication, Collaboration, and Shared Experiences in Mobile Video through Drones](2016_Jones_MobileVideo.md) by Brennan Jones, Kody Dillman, Richard Tang, Anthony Tang, Ehud Sharlin, Lora Oehlberg, Carman Neustaedter, and Scott Bateman in *DIS*

- The height of the drone and lack of resolution in its camera made it challenging for DPs to observe details in the scene.

[Boxing against drones: Drones in sports education](2016_Zwaan_Boxing.md) by Sergej G. Zwaan and Emilia I. Barakova in *IDC*

- Users do enjoy the concept of a drone as an exercise aid, and interaction designs involving drones could be used for exercises in which no or minimum impact is required.

[Drone Near Me: Exploring Touch-Based Human-Drone Interaction](2017_Abtahi_DroneNearMe.md) by Parastoo Abtahi, David Y. Zhao, Jane L. E, and James A. Landay in *IMWUT*

- The minimum distance between the participants and the safe-to-touch drone was less than the minimum distance in the control condition. In the safe-to-touch condition all participants interacted with the drone in their intimate space (< 1. 5ft) , compared to 42% in the control condition.

[DroneNavigator: Using Leashed and Free-Floating Quadcopters to Navigate Visually Impaired Travelers](2017_AvilaSoto_DroneNavigator.md) by Mauro Avila Soto, Markus Funk, Matthias Hoppe, Robin Boldt, Katrin Wolf, and Niels Henze in *ASSETS*

- Task completion time was fastest with the free-flying quadcopter, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the audio. Task completion time with the free-flying quadcopter was significantly faster than with the audio navigation.
- Audio navigation led to the most navigation errors, followed by the free-flying quadcopter. The leashed quadcopter led to the least errors. Differences were statistically signifiant.
- Audio navigation was perceived to be inducing the least workload, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the free-flying quadcopter. However, these differences were not statistically significant.
- Most participants preferred to use audio navigation, followed by the free-flying drone, then the leashed drone.
- The quadcopter was considered advantageous since it does not encumber the user.
- The leashed quadcopter was accepted as a precise navigation tool, but was not preferred since it encumbers both hands (one with the leash, while one is readily holding a cane).
- Despite leading to better task performance and various ergonomic advantages, acceptance of drones as a navigational aid was not higher than the technically "worse" solution (audio); due to a lack of confidence in the technology in diverse environments, noise characteristics, and concerns over social acceptance.

["Spiders in the Sky": User Perceptions of Drones, Privacy, and Security](2017_Chang_SpidersInTheSky.md) by Victoria Chang, Pramod Chundury, and Marshini Chetty in *CHI*

- Geo-fencing could be used to prevent drones from getting too close to places such as schools, government buildings, landmarks, or wildlife areas.
- We suggest that drone designers carefully consider the use of colors, logos, and decorations to make drones “friendly”, or “unfriendly” in cases where it is necessary for people to keep their distance from certain drones

[Investigating Drone Motion as Pedestrian Guidance](2017_Colley_InvestigatingDroneMotion.md) by Ashley Colley, Lasse Virtanen, Pascal Knierim, Jonna Häkkilä in *MUM*

- For straight ahead navigation, the drone should maintain a distance of approximately 3 - 4 m in front of the pedestrian and move at normal walking speed.

[Drone & Wo: Cultural Influences on Human-Drone Interaction Techniques](2017_Ilene_DroneWo.md) by Jane L. E, Ilene L. E, James A. Landay, and Jessica R. Cauchard in *CHI*

- The most preferred tasks that the drone companion would perform were to bring items to the user, clean for the user, give daily updates, cook food and follow around optionally.

[Exploring Proxemics in Human-Drone Interaction](2017_Yeh_ExploringProxemics.md) by Alexander Yeh, Photchara Ratsamee, Kiyoshi Kiyokawa, Yuki Uranishi, omohiro Mashita, Haruo Takemura, Morten Fjeld, and Mohammad Obaid in *HAI*

- The social drone performed significantly better in closing the distance than what the nonsocial drone could do.
- An average personal space of the social drone and human was closer when compared with the personal space between human and human.

[Social Proxemics of Human-Drone Interaction: Flying Altitude and Size](2018_Han_SocialProxemics.md) by Jeonghye Han and llhan Bae in *HRI*

- Participants approached further when interacting with eye leveled drones compared with overhead drones.
- Flight altitude matters significantly in social proximity of human-drone interaction.
- Gender and size of drone did not make significant differences in social proximity of human-drone interaction.
- South Korean participants can comfortably enter social space to interact with drones, and hovering drones in eye-level altitude seem to promote this attitude.

[Knowing You, Seeing Me: Investigating User Preferences in Drone-Human Acknowledgement](2018_Jensen_KnowingYouSeeingMe.md) by Walther Jensen, Simon Hansen, and Hendrik Knoche in *CHI*

- Designers need to consider both the available space and the drone speed to use gestures in flight.

[GazeDrone: Mobile Eye-Based Interaction in Public Space Without Augmenting the User](2018_Khamis_GazeDrone.md) by Mohamed Khamis, Anna Kienle, Florian Alt, and Andreas Bulling in *DroNet*
