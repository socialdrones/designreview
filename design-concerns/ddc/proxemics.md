1. Scheible et al. 2013
- Moving / subject following drone creates novel affordances for content (e.g. running shoe ad)

2. Schneegass et al. 2014a
- Readability is significantly worse when participant is walking
- No significant difference between readability in stationary, hovering, flying conditions
- Flight stability is not enough, causes “stress”
- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed
- Use cases should not involve moving user, but drone could move

3. Schneegass et al. 2014b
- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed

4. Avila, Funk, and Henze 2015
- The small drone was able to guide the blind participant precisely on paths with straight lines and turns.
- The small drone was able to guide the blind participant precisely in a populated room with its sound only, even in a populated and noisy environment.
- Drones are a feasible way to assist the visually impaired in navigation and object-finding.
- The sound of the drone's propellers itself is sufficient to locate the drone in the absence of sight, with a precision that allows for targets as small as 50cm.

5. Cauchard et al. 2015
- Repeated waving/sweeping was preferred for navigating the drone when far from the body, while smaller motions with body parts as reference were preferred within body range.

6. Mueller and Muirhead 2015
- Support “Contending for Space” to facilitate movement variety
- Use robot to direct focus away from the discomfort of exercise
- Utilize, not fight the robot’s secondary movements
- Utilize the shared space to support the movement 
- Exploit mutual exertion investment

7. Al-Zayer et al. 2016
- It may be feasible to use drones for tasks involving localization and nagivation at a slow pace, by the sound of the drone alone, without relying on sight.
- At a high pace, when running or undertaking physical exercise of intensity, it is not feasible to expect people to follow or localize a drone by sound alone, without sight.
- Results did not change when the distance between the drone and the participant was changed between 3m and 4m.

8. Jones et al. 2016
- The height of the drone and lack of resolution in its camera made it challenging for DPs to observe details in the scene.

9. Zwaan and Barakova 2016
- Users do enjoy the concept of a drone as an exercise aid, and interaction designs involving drones could be used for exercises in which no or minimum impact is required.

10. Abtahi et al. 2017
- The minimum distance between the participants and the safe-to-touch drone was less than the minimum distance in the control condition. In the safe-to-touch condition all participants interacted with the drone in their intimate space (< 1. 5ft) , compared to 42% in the control condition.

11. Avila Soto et al. 2017
- Task completion time was fastest with the free-flying quadcopter, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the audio. Task completion time with the free-flying quadcopter was significantly faster than with the audio navigation.
- Audio navigation led to the most navigation errors, followed by the free-flying quadcopter. The leashed quadcopter led to the least errors. Differences were statistically signifiant.
- Audio navigation was perceived to be inducing the least workload, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the free-flying quadcopter. However, these differences were not statistically significant.
- Most participants preferred to use audio navigation, followed by the free-flying drone, then the leashed drone.
- The quadcopter was considered advantageous since it does not encumber the user.
- The leashed quadcopter was accepted as a precise navigation tool, but was not preferred since it encumbers both hands (one with the leash, while one is readily holding a cane).
- Despite leading to better task performance and various ergonomic advantages, acceptance of drones as a navigational aid was not higher than the technically "worse" solution (audio); due to a lack of confidence in the technology in diverse environments, noise characteristics, and concerns over social acceptance.

12. Chang, Chundury, and Chetty 2017
- Geo-fencing could be used to prevent drones from getting too close to places such as schools, government buildings, landmarks, or wildlife areas.
- We suggest that drone designers carefully consider the use of colors, logos, and decorations to make drones “friendly”, or “unfriendly” in cases where it is necessary for people to keep their distance from certain drones

13. Colley et al. 2017
- For straight ahead navigation, the drone should maintain a distance of approximately 3 - 4 m in front of the pedestrian and move at normal walking speed.

14. E et al. 2017
- Participants in China allowed the drone to be extremely close,

15. Karjalainen 2017
- The most preferred tasks that the drone companion would perform were to bring items to the user, clean for the user, give daily updates, cook food and follow around optionally.

16. Yeh et al. 2017
- The social drone performed significantly better in closing the distance than what the nonsocial drone could do.
- An average personal space of the social drone and human was closer when compared with the personal space between human and human.

17. Han and Bae 2018
- Participants approached further when interacting with eye leveled drones compared with overhead drones.
- Flight altitude matters significantly in social proximity of human-drone interaction.
- Gender and size of drone did not make significant differences in social proximity of human-drone interaction.
- South Korean participants can comfortably enter social space to interact with drones, and hovering drones in eye-level altitude seem to promote this attitude.

18. Jensen, Hansen, and Knoche 2018
- Designers need to consider both the available space and the drone speed to use gestures in flight.

19. Khamis et al. 2018
- Drone should hover with an adjustable camera angle at an altitude below the user’s height, and use small drones (3 x 3 x 2 cm).

20. Uchidiuno, Weisz, and Manweller 2018
- Privacy-preserving technologies can reduce privacy-related drone fears.
- Technologies that prevent the capture of data in sensitive situations had the greatest impact, and technologies that allow individuals to query a drone for its owner, purpose, and data being collected also helped significantly.
