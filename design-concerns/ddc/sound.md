# Sound

1. Scheible et al. 2013
- Very attention-grabbing: as a flying object, noise source, and light source

2. Arroyo et al. 2014
- Movements without propeller noise tended to generate positive emotions, while movements with operating propellers evoked the opposite.

3. Avila, Funk, and Henze 2015
- The sound of the drone's propellers itself is sufficient to locate the drone in the absence of sight, with a precision that allows for targets as small as 50cm.

4 .Cauchard et al. 2015
- Noise and airflow around the drone led to discomfort.

5. Obaid et al. 2015
- Mutimodal interaction (audio+visual) with a drone was found to be more effective and "sensible" than audio-only and visual-only modalities.

6. Al-Zayer et al. 2016
- It may be feasible to use drones for tasks involving localization and nagivation at a slow pace, by the sound of the drone alone, without relying on sight.
- At a high pace, when running or undertaking physical exercise of intensity, it is not feasible to expect people to follow or localize a drone by sound alone, without sight.

7. Jones et al. 2016
- FPs were genrally comfortable around the drone, but some reported discomfort with propeller noise.

8. Avila Soto et al. 2017
- Task completion time was fastest with the free-flying quadcopter, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the audio. Task completion time with the free-flying quadcopter was significantly faster than with the audio navigation.
- Audio navigation led to the most navigation errors, followed by the free-flying quadcopter. The leashed quadcopter led to the least errors. Differences were statistically signifiant.
- Audio navigation was perceived to be inducing the least workload, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the free-flying quadcopter. However, these differences were not statistically significant.
- Most participants preferred to use audio navigation, followed by the free-flying drone, then the leashed drone.
- The quadcopter was considered advantageous since it does not encumber the user.
- Confidence in quadcopter navigation was not high, since it may be difficult to perceive it in noisy environments, and the noise became annoying to participants after a while.
- The leashed quadcopter was accepted as a precise navigation tool, but was not preferred since it encumbers both hands (one with the leash, while one is readily holding a cane).
- Despite leading to better task performance and various ergonomic advantages, acceptance of drones as a navigational aid was not higher than the technically "worse" solution (audio); due to a lack of confidence in the technology in diverse environments, noise characteristics, and concerns over social acceptance.

9. Chang, Chundury, and Chetty 2017
- Drone designs should explore the use of non-visual cues and recording feedback to enhance users’ privacy and security.
- All of the drone group participants had a negative reaction to the sound that the drone made.
- To help protect wildlife, we also suggest that drones could be designed with visual or audio animal repellents.

10. Colley et al. 2017
- The drone’s loud noise was commented negatively by 7/10 participants.

11. Yeh et al. 2017
- Noise of the drone added to the mental stress of any human in the vicinity of the drone.

14. Walker et al. 2018
- ARHMD technology can significantly improve user understandings of robot intent and increase objective task efficiency.
