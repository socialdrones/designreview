# Control

1. Ng and Sharlin 2011
- Using gestures is more natural and less cognitively demanding for casual/novice users, compared to using a controller which demands attention switching between drone and controller.
- Using gestures to control a drone can be used to induce attachment / socialization, as if it were a pet.
- Free hand gestures are preferred over those involving props.
- Gesture + voice is preferred over gesture alone.
- Gesture speed/magnitude is expected to correlate with drone behavior.

2. Cauchard et al. 2015
- Participants largely preferred to interact with the drone through gestures alone, then with voice, and then with a combination of gesture and voice (in tandem or in sequence). (A small number of prop-based interactions was discarded from analysis.)
- Many participants initially expressed discomfort in talking with a drone, but grew used to it over time.
- Gestures were preferred as they are quick and allow for precise adjustments and continuous control.
- Repeated waving/sweeping was preferred for navigating the drone when far from the body, while smaller motions with body parts as reference were preferred within body range.
- Framing and "invisible camera" gestures were preferred with high agreement for photo-taking, as well as commands involving the word "picture."
- Feelings of naturalness, safety, perceived control over the drone were rated highly, while the interactions were not considered to be physical and mentaly demanding.
- Indications for when the drone is listening/receiving commands were noted as a desirable feature.
- "Interacting with a person" and "interacting with a pet" were observed as preferred high-level design metaphors.

3. Chen, Liu, and Yu 2015
- When taking selfies, users will first hold the smartphone or the camera to a proper location and then check the composition on the screen, and then take the selfie.
- Taking selfies with a drone should involve two stages: Positioning and framing.

4. Jones et al. 2016
- The height of the drone and lack of resolution in its camera made it challenging for DPs to observe details in the scene.
- The two participants had difficulty in communicating precise navigational cues due to the lack of a shared frame of reference.
- Lack of extensive control over the drone's positioning was frustrating to some DPs.
- FPs were challenged by the responsibility and concern related to making sure that the autonomous following drone flies properly and sees what they want it to see.
- The drone was utilized as a shared resource between the two participants, requiring constant communication, attention, and behavior change in order to cooperate properly.
- The problem of having multiple reference frames in this application was an essential challenge, and adequately handling it is predicated on technical as well as design domains.
- Rather than fully autonomous, algorithmic control of the drone's flight, in scenarios like the one investigated, the option to override autonomous control and pilot the drone remotely could be beneficial, but adds significant complexity to the design, which warrants further investigation.
- Both parties must be fully considered when designing interactions with and behavior of an autonomous drone that is meant to serve as a shared resource. (In this case, the design focused on the DPs' experience.)
- Having an elevated view over the scene while collaborating with an on-the-ground person is a concept which was well-accepted by participants, who suggested numerous other applications for the concept.

5. Kim, Kim, and Kim 2016
- The drone was envisioned in various social roles, clustered as "servant," "pet," "friend," and "bully;" which varied (in a decreasing fashion, respectively) on a principal design dimension identified as "perceived controllability." Participants were more appealed to by a drone that has the ability to fulfill multiple roles, rather than one; but higher preference was expressed for roles with higher perceived controllability.
- Participants expressed preference towards an ability to "train" the drone (e.g. as one would a pet), rather than having direct control over it.
- Participants expressed a preference/openness towards slightly unpredictable/playful drone behavior.
- Three solutions are suggested when designing drone as a companion:
- The drone should possess functions that fill up both utilitarian and hedonic value.
- Moderate and situationally adaptable level of controllability over the drone is preferred, rather than full autonomy or full control.
- "Tolerable" predictability of the drone is preferred, but not full or little predictability.

6. Obaid et al. 2016
- "Dynamic" gestures were preferred over "static" ones for almost all commands.
- Gestures of a "deictic" nature were often preferred for navigational commands, while "emblematic" and "metaphoric" gestures were preferred for "take picture" and "record video" commands.
- A reasonably high level of agreement exists between people in terms of which gestures feel intutive for issuing various navigational or movement commands to a drone.
- There is more variance between people in terms of which gestures feel intuitive for commands like "take picture" or "record video."

7. Abtahi et al. 2017
- In safe-to-touch condition, 58% of participants touched the drone and 39% of all interactions were touch-based.
- Interacting with the safe-to-touch drone was reported to be significantly less mentally demanding than the unsafe drone.
- Majority of users (83%) reported that they felt safe while interacting with it.

8. Chang, Chundury, and Chetty 2017
- Geo-fencing could be used to prevent drones from getting too close to places such as schools, government buildings, landmarks, or wildlife areas.
- One possibility for future work would be to explore how drones could operate in designated spaces or drone “highways”.

9. E et al. 2017
- Support should be designed for multi-modal interaction allowing use of slight variation in gestures, and extra contextual words.
- When Chinese participants used multi-modal interaction, the sound would often (75%) align in meaning with the gestural interaction (i.e., palm out, “stop”). For the other 25% of multi-modal interactions, the sound augmented the gesture used to convey the task.
- There were cultural agreement for the tasks “come closer”, “take a picture” and “go sideways”
- There were cultural disagreement for the tasks “stop”,”fly higher”
- It is important to avoid ambiguity. The addition of voice could also aid in clarifying intention.
- Both Chinese and US participants were likely to compare the interactions with the drone to those with people.
- Chinese participants were less likely than US ones to think of the drone as a pet
- Chinese participants overall felt interacting with the drone was more physically demanding
- Chinese participants showed relational behaviours like waving or encouraging the drone.

10. Karjalainen 2017
- Preferred social role of the drone is as an assistant, butler, toy and device/computer.
- The preferred interactions are voice control, gesture control, smartphone control, and the drone to be partly autonomous.

11. Yeh et al. 2017
- On average, the personal space of social drone with greeting voice is reduced by 30% when compared to nonsocial drone without greeting voice.
- The social drone performed significantly better in closing the distance than what the nonsocial drone could do.

12. Brock et al. 2018
- Spatial technique enabled remembering more POIs correctly, but it required more physical demand.
- The system should recognize gestures from different users, allowing people to interact together in groups.

13. Khamis et al. 2018
- Input was significantly more accurate when stationary compared to when moving parallel to the display.
- No evidence of differences in performance among the other movement conditions.
- There are more “incorrect user inputs” in the parallel movement condition.
- Performing selection tasks is easier compared to sliding tasks
- Interacting while moving parallel to the display is unnatural and demanding.

14. Kim and Landay 2018
- All participants were aware that the dancer’s movement affected the motion of the drones.
- Aeroquake holded the attention of 80% of the participants most of the time or the entire time.
- Aeroquake satisfied the design principles for technology-augmented dance.

15. Knierim et al. 2018a
- For drag interactions, use the defined interaction space for standing users.
- The haptic feedback should be sufficient for draw output modality.

16. Uchidiuno, Weisz, and Manweller 2018
- Privacy-preserving technologies can reduce privacy-related drone fears.
- Technologies that prevent the capture of data in sensitive situations had the greatest impact, and technologies that allow individuals to query a drone for its owner, purpose, and data being collected also helped significantly.

17. Walker et al. 2018
- ARHMD technology can significantly improve user understandings of robot intent and increase objective task efficiency.
