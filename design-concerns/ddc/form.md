# Form

How do aspects of the visual appearance of a drone (including size, shape, color, and appendages) impact user/bystander experiences?

## Summary Analysis

Both technical and aesthetic aspects of visual/formal design in social drones are most saliently linked with a human-centered concern we termed [appeal](https://github.com/socialdrones/designreview/blob/master/design-concerns/hcc/appeal.md), which covers both initial and in-use experiences with drones that drive acquisition, adoption, acceptance, safety perceptions, etc. While a number of factors relating to how the visual appearance of a drone impacts these perceptions are culture- and application-dependent, consensus exists around some factors such as size - the smaller, the better; unless prohibited by technical requirements. A related concern is the [social roles](https://github.com/socialdrones/designreview/blob/master/design-concerns/hcc/role.md) to be fulfilled by drones and existing conventions that scaffold them; where in sum, the visual design of drones are expected to be congruent with the kinds of social roles the ought to fulfill (e.g. using a softer, more "approachable" formal language for a drone which is to provide companionship, and more aggressive designs for defense applications).

For interactive drones that call for tactile manipulation, the form is again a salient design concern, and size again seems to be an important formal consideration: a tangible drone has to eiths fit into the hand, or have suitable appendages that communicate tactile affordances.

Beyond what is communicated by the formal design in subtle ways, more explicit and dynamic commnication is possible through incorporating [lights and displays](https://github.com/socialdrones/designreview/blob/master/design-concerns/ddc/displays.md) on drones (deliniated as a seperate drone design concern, see link).

- We suggest that drone designers carefully consider the use of colors, logos, and decorations to make drones “friendly”, or “unfriendly” in cases where it is necessary for people to keep their distance from certain drones.
- Drone sizes could be balanced to ensure that they are not perceived as too stealthy or concealing dangerous items.

- Participants were neutral about the animal like appearance. On how machine-like the drone should be, participants were slightly leaning towards a machine-like appearance. Participants wanted to see some human-like behavior.
- The preferred drone appearance was a round shape and with a face. Other preferred features were arms, eyes and machine like features.
