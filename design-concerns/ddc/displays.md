# Lights and Displays

*How can drone-mounted lights and displays (on a con-tinuum of resolution characteristics) be used as a communication media to communicate internal system states and other messages?*

## Summary Analysis

Designs that augment the appearance of a social drone with lights and displays meant to communicate system states, movement intentions, and other messages, as well as applications that use drones to implement novel display methods, are examples of works where lights and displays are investigated as a primary design concern. In terms of design outcomes, this concern connects to numerous human-centered aspects. For example, designs that leverage displays to create anthropomorphic or animal-like features on drones have been proposed to enhance the [appeal](https://github.com/socialdrones/designreview/blob/master/design-concerns/hcc/appeal.md) of social drones in home scenarios. More commonly, research has looked into how lights and displays can be used to alert users and bystanders of intented drone actions and states, such as where the drone will fly to next, or whether or not it is recording video or audio at a given moment. Heuristics emerging from these investigations are covered under the human-centered concern of [intuitive comprehehsion](https://github.com/socialdrones/designreview/blob/master/design-concerns/hcc/comprehension.md), since the intention with many of these designs is to make affordances and information clear in encountered interactions with novice or lay users, without using high-resolution messages. 

In the case of novel displays that are implemented using drones (e.g. drone mounted projectors, projection surfaces, and e-ink displays; as well as using drones themselves as levitating pixels), the primary issue often becomes the legibility and ergonomics of the design, since the interactions with these designs are largely one-sided with the human as a spectator. Heuristics emerging from these studies are covered under the human-centered concern [ergonomics](https://github.com/socialdrones/designreview/blob/master/design-concerns/hcc/ergonomics.md).

[Midair Displays: Concept and First Experiences with Free-Floating Pervasive Displays](2014_Schneegass_PerDis.md) by Stefan Schneegass, Florian Alt, Jürgen Scheible, and Albrecht Schmidt in *PerDis*

- Readability is significantly worse when participant is walking.
- No significant difference between readability in stationary, hovering, flying conditions
- Proposed use cases for free-floating pervasive displays: Emergency, advertisement, group displays, entertainment, notifications, hands-occupied cases like swimming/skiing; group use more likely than individual
- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed for free-floating pervasive displays.
- Use cases should not involve moving user, but drone could move.

- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed for midair displays.
- Battery life must be considered
- Midair Displays are preferred while walking, standing, swimming; not while biking, driving

[A Drone Agent to Support a Clean Environment](2015_Obaid_Environment.md) by Mohammad Obaid, Omar Mubin, Christina Anne Basedow, A. Ayça Ünlüer, Matz Johansson Bergström, and Morten Fjeld in *HAI*

- Multimodal interaction (audio+visual) with a drone was found to be more effective and "sensible" than audio-only and visual-only modalities.

[Communicating Directionality in Flying Robots](2015_Szafir_CommunicatingDirectionality.md) by Daniel Szafir, Bilge Mutlu, and Terry Fong in *HRI*

- Users preferred signal specificity at the cost of generalizability and overall found gaze behaviors to be highly useful in improving flyer abilities to communicate and collaborate effectively.
- User responses support the notion that visual cues should convey high level aspects of flight intentions rather than low level corrections to flight paths.

[In-Situ-DisplayDrone: Facilitating Co-located Interactive Experiences via A Flying Screen](2016_Scheible_InSituDisplayDrone.md) by Jürgen Scheible and Markus Funk in *PerDis*

- Both prototypes were met with positive, "joyful" reactions.
- In outdoor deployments, the apparatus may become unstable in strong wind conditions (largely because of the canvas moving); and can only be used in calm weather.

["Spiders in the Sky": User Perceptions of Drones, Privacy, and Security](2017_Chang_SpidersInTheSky.md) by Victoria Chang, Pramod Chundury, and Marshini Chetty in *CHI*

- Drone designs should explore the use of non-visual cues and recording feedback to enhance users’ privacy and security.
- We suggest that drone designers carefully consider the use of colors, logos, and decorations to make drones “friendly”, or “unfriendly” in cases where it is necessary for people to keep their distance from certain drones

- Participants were neutral about the animal like appearance. On how machine-like the drone should be, participants were slightly leaning towards a machine-like appearance. Participants wanted to see some human-like behavior.
- The preferred drone appearance was a round shape and with a face. Other preferred features were arms, eyes and machine like features.

- The social drone (drone with a tablet as a face) performed significantly better in closing the distance than what the nonsocial drone could do.

- For drone-based maps, all the visual information should be integrated into a single display (the projection).

[Quadcopter-Projected In-Situ Navigation Cues for Improved Location Awareness](2018_Knierim_Quadcopter-ProjectedInSituNavigationCues.md) by Pascal Knierim, Steffen Maurer, Katrin Wolf, and Markus Funk in *CHI*

- In-situ navigation instructions provided by the levitating quadcopter were leading to a significantly shorter distance compared to the smartphone-based navigation instructions.
- Participants required considerably more time to complete a route using in-situ navigation instructions using a levitating projector.
- Participants could memorize points of interest significantly more accurately using in-situ instructions.
- Using in-situ navigation instructions while walking leads to a higher memorability of the surroundings as opposed to mobile phone navigation, but it requires more time.

[Privacy and Fear in the Drone Era: Preserving Privacy Expectations Through Technology](2018_Uchidiuno_PrivacyandFear.md) by Judith Uchidiuno, Justin D. Weisz, and Justin Manweller in *CHI EA*

- Privacy-preserving technologies can reduce privacy-related drone fears.
- Technologies that prevent the capture of data in sensitive situations had the greatest impact, and technologies that allow individuals to query a drone for its owner, purpose, and data being collected also helped significantly.
