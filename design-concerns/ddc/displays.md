# Lights and Displays

1. Scheible et al. 2013
- Projector considerations: darkness, distance
- Very attention-grabbing: as a flying object, noise source, and light source

2. Arroyo et al. 2014
- Human-robot interaction can be improved by giving the robot the faculty to perform different emotional states through a communication interface.
- Subjects were not always consistent for each interpretation that comprehended head movements and eye color.

3. Schneegass et al. 2014a
- Readability is significantly worse when participant is walking.
- No significant difference between readability in stationary, hovering, flying conditions
- Proposed use cases for free-floating pervasive displays: Emergency, advertisement, group displays, entertainment, notifications, hands-occupied cases like swimming/skiing; group use more likely than individual
- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed for free-floating pervasive displays.
- Use cases should not involve moving user, but drone could move.

4. Schneegass et al. 2014b
- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed for midair displays.
- Battery life must be considered
- Midair Displays are preferred while walking, standing, swimming; not while biking, driving

5. Obaid et al. 2015
- Multimodal interaction (audio+visual) with a drone was found to be more effective and "sensible" than audio-only and visual-only modalities.

6. Szafir, Mutlu, and Fong 2015
- Users preferred signal specificity at the cost of generalizability and overall found gaze behaviors to be highly useful in improving flyer abilities to communicate and collaborate effectively.
- User responses support the notion that visual cues should convey high level aspects of flight intentions rather than low level corrections to flight paths.

7. Scheible and Funk 2016
- Both prototypes were met with positive, "joyful" reactions.
- In outdoor deployments, the apparatus may become unstable in strong wind conditions (largely because of the canvas moving); and can only be used in calm weather.

8. Chang, Chundury, and Chetty 2017
- Drone designs should explore the use of non-visual cues and recording feedback to enhance users’ privacy and security.
- We suggest that drone designers carefully consider the use of colors, logos, and decorations to make drones “friendly”, or “unfriendly” in cases where it is necessary for people to keep their distance from certain drones

9. Karjalainen 2017
- Participants were neutral about the animal like appearance. On how machine-like the drone should be, participants were slightly leaning towards a machine-like appearance. Participants wanted to see some human-like behavior.
- The preferred drone appearance was a round shape and with a face. Other preferred features were arms, eyes and machine like features.

10. Yeh et al. 2017
- The social drone (drone with a tablet as a face) performed significantly better in closing the distance than what the nonsocial drone could do.

11. Brock et al. 2018
- For drone-based maps, all the visual information should be integrated into a single display (the projection).

12. Knierim et al. 2018a
-

13. Knierim et al. 2018b
- In-situ navigation instructions provided by the levitating quadcopter were leading to a significantly shorter distance compared to the smartphone-based navigation instructions.
- Participants required considerably more time to complete a route using in-situ navigation instructions using a levitating projector.
- Participants could memorize points of interest significantly more accurately using in-situ instructions.
- Using in-situ navigation instructions while walking leads to a higher memorability of the surroundings as opposed to mobile phone navigation, but it requires more time.

14. Uchidiuno, Weisz, and Manweller 2018
- Privacy-preserving technologies can reduce privacy-related drone fears.
- Technologies that prevent the capture of data in sensitive situations had the greatest impact, and technologies that allow individuals to query a drone for its owner, purpose, and data being collected also helped significantly.

15. Walker et al. 2018
- ARHMD technology can significantly improve user understandings of robot intent and increase objective task efficiency.
