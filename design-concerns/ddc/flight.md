# Flight

*How can a drone’s movements and stance be used in interaction designs as a communicative medium? How are designs for motion patterns or styles (informed by theory) perceived on various cognitive and sentimental levels?*

## Summary Analysis

Human perception and understanding of the external world (including other living beings) are driven on a very fundamental level by movement. Reflexive responses to environmental happenings due to movement happen much faster than those due to information of other kinds (e.g. we are instinctively driven to dodge an object hurled towards us, long before we comprehend what the object is); and our perceptions of the internal state of other living beings is influenced heavily by their movement qualitites. Similarly, in the social drone design space, movement qualities are intimately linked to a dimension of outcomes we term [intuitive comprehension](https://github.com/socialdrones/designreview/blob/master/design-concerns/hcc/comprehension.md), where prior research has explored themes around communicating information on internal states and intentions of drones via flight characteristics. As with qualities that manifest in visual/formal ways, flight is also linked to concerns around [product appeal](https://github.com/socialdrones/designreview/blob/master/design-concerns/hcc/appeal.md) and [role](https://github.com/socialdrones/designreview/blob/master/design-concerns/hcc/role.md). Across all of these concerns, researchers have observed that smooth, stable movements that incorporate easing and similar techniques are preferable, in that they evoke perceptions of safety and comfort, and improve the legibility of movement-based communications. Flight movements also have potential to be exploited as a feedback channel during high-level drone [control](https://github.com/socialdrones/designreview/blob/master/design-concerns/hcc/control.md).

 - Current commercial drones do not appear to be as agile, responsive, and effective as a human partner in functioning as an intensive training and practice aid for boxing.
- Users do enjoy the concept of a drone as an exercise aid, and interaction designs involving drones could be used for exercises in which no or minimum impact is required.
 
[Drone Near Me: Exploring Touch-Based Human-Drone Interaction](2017_Abtahi_DroneNearMe.md) by Parastoo Abtahi, David Y. Zhao, Jane L. E, and James A. Landay in *IMWUT*

- Task completion time was fastest with the free-flying quadcopter, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the audio. Task completion time with the free-flying quadcopter was significantly faster than with the audio navigation.
- Audio navigation led to the most navigation errors, followed by the free-flying quadcopter. The leashed quadcopter led to the least errors. Differences were statistically signifiant.
- Audio navigation was perceived to be inducing the least workload, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the free-flying quadcopter. However, these differences were not statistically significant.
- Most participants preferred to use audio navigation, followed by the free-flying drone, then the leashed drone.
- The quadcopter was considered advantageous since it does not encumber the user.
- The leashed quadcopter was accepted as a precise navigation tool, but was not preferred since it encumbers both hands (one with the leash, while one is readily holding a cane).
- Despite leading to better task performance and various ergonomic advantages, acceptance of drones as a navigational aid was not higher than the technically "worse" solution (audio); due to a lack of confidence in the technology in diverse environments, noise characteristics, and concerns over social acceptance.
 
["Spiders in the Sky": User Perceptions of Drones, Privacy, and Security](2017_Chang_SpidersInTheSky.md) by Victoria Chang, Pramod Chundury, and Marshini Chetty in *CHI*

- Seven drone group participants commented negatively on the breeze that they felt from the drone while in flight.
- Movements of a drone can significantly impact participants’ concerns about their physical safety and about drones invading private space.
- Geo-fencing could be used to prevent drones from getting too close to places such as schools, government buildings, landmarks, or wildlife areas.
- One possibility for future work would be to explore how drones could operate in designated spaces or drone “highways”.
 
[Investigating Drone Motion as Pedestrian Guidance](2017_Colley_InvestigatingDroneMotion.md) by Ashley Colley, Lasse Virtanen, Pascal Knierim, Jonna Häkkilä in *MUM*

- For indicating the need to turn a corner, both studies delivered a strong preference for a tilting gesture, rapidly towards the direction of the turn and returning more slowly to horizontal.
- Drone motion for cases where the drone is required, e.g. due to environmental circumstances, to move further away from the pedestrian was found to be challenging gestures for such cases will require further study.

[Knowing You, Seeing Me: Investigating User Preferences in Drone-Human Acknowledgement](2018_Jensen_KnowingYouSeeingMe.md) by Walther Jensen, Simon Hansen, and Hendrik Knoche in *CHI*

- Gestures have to be sufficiently different from an approach or hovering posture.
- Due to external factors such as wind and sensor noise drones need to use corrective maneuvers to maintain their desired speed and orientation in terms of roll, pitch, and yaw. Gestures should be sufficiently different from such maneuvers
- Designers need to consider both the available space and the drone speed to use gestures in flight.
- Drones need to adapt the gestures they use and how to perform them according to wind strength and direction.
- High rotational (yaw) speeds (200°/sec) appeared as uncontrolled behavior and slow speeds (50°/sec) resulted in unresponsive flights in our implementation. We found 100°/sec suitable for orienting and employed 66°/sec for nods and tosses and 133°/sec for waggles.
- Changes in drone speeds were perceived as potentially threatening, aggressive, or erratic behavior.
 
[GazeDrone: Mobile Eye-Based Interaction in Public Space Without Augmenting the User](2018_Khamis_GazeDrone.md) by Mohamed Khamis, Anna Kienle, Florian Alt, and Andreas Bulling in *DroNet*

- Input was significantly more accurate when stationary compared to when moving parallel to the display.
- No evidence of differences in performance among the other movement conditions.
- There are more “incorrect user inputs” in the parallel movement condition.
- Performing selection tasks is easier compared to sliding tasks
- Interacting while moving parallel to the display is unnatural and demanding.
- Drone should hover with an adjustable camera angle at an altitude below the user’s height, and use small drones (3 x 3 x 2 cm).

- Participants required considerably more time to complete a route using in-situ navigation instructions using a levitating projector.
- Participants could memorize points of interest significantly more accurately using in-situ instructions.
- Using in-situ navigation instructions while walking leads to a higher memorability of the surroundings as opposed to mobile phone navigation, but it requires more time.
