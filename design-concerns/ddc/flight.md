# Flight

1. Scheible et al. 2013
- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed
- Moving / subject following drone creates novel affordances for content (e.g. running shoe ad)

2. Arroyo et al. 2014
- Subjects were not always consistent for each interpretation that comprehended head movements and eye color.

3. Schneegass et al. 2014a
- Readability is significantly worse when participant is walking
- No significant difference between readability in stationary, hovering, flying conditions
- Flight stability is not enough, causes “stress”
- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed
- Use cases should not involve moving user, but drone could move

4. Schneegass et al. 2014b
- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed for midair displays
- Battery life must be considered

5. Szafir, Mutlu, and Fong 2014
- Smooth velocities may be particularly important when closely interacting with users, for intuitive comprehension of drone intent.
- Arcing may effectively signal that an AFF will not approach or collide with a user or other objects, hance inspiring a perception of safety and stability / being in control.
- Intentful design of flight motions is effective in inspiring positive user sentiment towards using and being with a drone.
 
 6. Mueller and Muirhead 2015
- Support “Contending for Space” to facilitate movement variety
- Use robot to direct focus away from the discomfort of exercise
- Utilize, not fight the robot’s secondary movements
- Utilize the shared space to support the movement 
- Exploit mutual exertion investment
 
 7. Obaid et al. 2015
- Comments indicated that fully autonomous drones performing chores by themselves are preferable to those trying to persuade humans.
- Perceptions of safety, privacy, acceptance, and overall appeal of autonomous drones directly interacting with humans in public spaces emerged as mixed and negative.
 
 8. Cauchard et al. 2016
- Flight parameters such as flight path, reaction time, altitute, orientation, and speed; as well as reactivity/compliance, are effective in establishing intuitively comprehensible drone behaviors.
- Human interpretations of drone behavior are often based on expectations formed by animal behavior.
 
 9. Hieida et al. 2016
- Sentiments of pleasure–displeasure and arousal–sleepy can be conveyed through movements in the "gravitational" direction.
- Sentiments of powerful–delicate, pinpointing–flexible, and hasty–leisurely can be conveyed through movements in both "gravitational" and "personal" directions.
 
 10. Jones et al. 2016
- Rather than fully autonomous, algorithmic control of the drone's flight, in scenarios like the one investigated, the option to override autonomous control and pilot the drone remotely could be beneficial, but adds significant complexity to the design, which warrants further investigation.
 
 11. Kim, Kim, and Kim 2016
- Proposed applications with utilitarian value capitalized on the drone's ability to fly; e.g. transportation of objects, navigation, surveillance, air freshening, and filming.
 
 12. Yamaguchi et al. 2016
- The haptic display was helpful (in a statistically significant manner) in assisting users to draw a straight line mid-air.
- Drones have potential in being used for implementations of haptic feedback mechanisms for virtual reality, with advantages over static/grounded haptic feedback mechanisms.
 
 13. Zwaan and Barakova 2016
- The drone was perceived to be slower and less dynamic than a human sparring partner, which decreased the intensity of exercise.
 - Current commercial drones do not appear to be as agile, responsive, and effective as a human partner in functioning as an intensive training and practice aid for boxing.
- Users do enjoy the concept of a drone as an exercise aid, and interaction designs involving drones could be used for exercises in which no or minimum impact is required.
 
 14. Avila Soto et al. 2017
- Task completion time was fastest with the free-flying quadcopter, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the audio. Task completion time with the free-flying quadcopter was significantly faster than with the audio navigation.
- Audio navigation led to the most navigation errors, followed by the free-flying quadcopter. The leashed quadcopter led to the least errors. Differences were statistically signifiant.
- Audio navigation was perceived to be inducing the least workload, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the free-flying quadcopter. However, these differences were not statistically significant.
- Most participants preferred to use audio navigation, followed by the free-flying drone, then the leashed drone.
- The quadcopter was considered advantageous since it does not encumber the user.
- The leashed quadcopter was accepted as a precise navigation tool, but was not preferred since it encumbers both hands (one with the leash, while one is readily holding a cane).
- Despite leading to better task performance and various ergonomic advantages, acceptance of drones as a navigational aid was not higher than the technically "worse" solution (audio); due to a lack of confidence in the technology in diverse environments, noise characteristics, and concerns over social acceptance.
 
 15. Chang, Chundury, and Chetty 2017
- Seven drone group participants commented negatively on the breeze that they felt from the drone while in flight.
- Movements of a drone can significantly impact participants’ concerns about their physical safety and about drones invading private space.
- Geo-fencing could be used to prevent drones from getting too close to places such as schools, government buildings, landmarks, or wildlife areas.
- One possibility for future work would be to explore how drones could operate in designated spaces or drone “highways”.
 
 16. Colley et al. 2017
- For indicating the need to turn a corner, both studies delivered a strong preference for a tilting gesture, rapidly towards the direction of the turn and returning more slowly to horizontal.
- Drone motion for cases where the drone is required, e.g. due to environmental circumstances, to move further away from the pedestrian was found to be challenging gestures for such cases will require further study.
 
 17. Yeh et al. 2017
- An average personal space of the social drone and human was closer when compared with the personal space between human and human.
 
 18. Han and Bae 2018
- Participants approached further when interacting with eye leveled drones compared with overhead drones.
- Flight altitude matters significantly in social proximity of human-drone interaction.
 
 19. Jensen, Hansen, and Knoche 2018
- Gestures have to be sufficiently different from an approach or hovering posture.
- Due to external factors such as wind and sensor noise drones need to use corrective maneuvers to maintain their desired speed and orientation in terms of roll, pitch, and yaw. Gestures should be sufficiently different from such maneuvers
- Designers need to consider both the available space and the drone speed to use gestures in flight.
- Drones need to adapt the gestures they use and how to perform them according to wind strength and direction.
- High rotational (yaw) speeds (200°/sec) appeared as uncontrolled behavior and slow speeds (50°/sec) resulted in unresponsive flights in our implementation. We found 100°/sec suitable for orienting and employed 66°/sec for nods and tosses and 133°/sec for waggles.
- Changes in drone speeds were perceived as potentially threatening, aggressive, or erratic behavior.
 
 20. Khamis et al. 2018
- Input was significantly more accurate when stationary compared to when moving parallel to the display.
- No evidence of differences in performance among the other movement conditions.
- There are more “incorrect user inputs” in the parallel movement condition.
- Performing selection tasks is easier compared to sliding tasks
- Interacting while moving parallel to the display is unnatural and demanding.
- Drone should hover with an adjustable camera angle at an altitude below the user’s height, and use small drones (3 x 3 x 2 cm).
 
 21. Kim and Landay 2018
- All participants were aware that the dancer’s movement affected the motion of the drones.
- Aeroquake satisfied the design principles for technology-augmented dance.
 
 22. Knierim et al. 2018b
- In-situ navigation instructions provided by the levitating quadcopter were leading to a significantly shorter distance compared to the smartphone-based navigation instructions.
- Participants required considerably more time to complete a route using in-situ navigation instructions using a levitating projector.
- Participants could memorize points of interest significantly more accurately using in-situ instructions.
- Using in-situ navigation instructions while walking leads to a higher memorability of the surroundings as opposed to mobile phone navigation, but it requires more time.
 
 22. Tan, Lee, and Gao 2018
- Participants described a drone’s flying behaviors as a reflection of the drone’s emotional status (e.g. angry, nervous and fierce).
- Leave enough spaces and give enough controls to users when design the HDI procedure.
