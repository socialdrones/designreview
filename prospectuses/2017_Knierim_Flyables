### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

Which human-drone interaction modalities are preferred by users?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Indoor Live study with 17 participants.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

1. Quadcopter (Eachine H8) equipped with a cardboard cage
1. An OptiTrack Tracking System
1. Arduino Uno (Flight Control)

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- No significant difference between user ratings for different heights, 53% of participants liked the altitude of 140 cm most. 
- All participants used their whole hand during drag interactions.
- The interaction space has a median height of 93 cm to 189 cm above the ground and a width of 109 cm. Participants dragged the tangible in average 5 cm further to the right than left. The median forward movement is 50 cm.
- The draw in the forward direction was the most perceptible
- Proposed use cases: Controlling smart home devices; Haptic feedback tool in VR
- Drawbacks: Noise, battery life, weak drag (during drag interaction).

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- For drag interactions, use the defined interaction space for standing users.
- Tangible should idle at an altitude between elbow and breast (140 cm) to enable a comfortable use.
- The haptic feedback was not sufficient for draw output modality.
- The size of the cage should consist of a size between 10 cm×10 cm and 12 cm×12 cm. 
- Quadcopter frames should enclose levitating tangibles.
