*by Jeonghye Han, Ilhan Bae, in HRI '18* - [10.1145/3173386.3177527](https://doi.org/10.1145/3173386.3177527)

### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

To what extent do humans comfortably approach to hovering drones?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. A Live Study with 32 South Korean participants.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

- A small and a big sized drone
- An acrylic panel

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- Participants approached further when interacting with eye leveled drones compared with overhead drones. 
- Flight altitude matters significantly in social proximity of human-drone interaction. 
- Gender and size of drone did not make significant differences in social proximity of human-drone interaction. 

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- South Korean participants can comfortably enter social space to interact with drones, and hovering drones in eye-level altitude seem to promote this attitude.
