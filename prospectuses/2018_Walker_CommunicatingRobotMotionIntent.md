*by Michael Walker, Hooman Hedayati, Jennifer Lee, Daniel Szafir, in HRI '18* - [10.1145/3171221.3171253](https://doi.org/10.1145/3171221.3171253)

### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How ARHMD technology might mediate collocated human-robot interaction by providing feedback on robot motion intent?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Indoor VR “Live” user study with 60 participants.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

- Robotic Platform: AscTec Hummingbird
- HoloLens
- Unity

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- Total time lost to interruptions significantly decreased using NavPoints, Arrow, and Gaze, but not Utilities.
- NavPoints design was rated significantly higher on clarity than the baseline, but there was no significant effects from the other designs.
- NavPoints was the only design to significantly improve perceptions of the robot as a personal work partner and as a work partner for others over the baseline.
- NavPoints, Arrow, and Gaze, were ranked as significantly more helpful than Utilities. NavPoints was rated as significantly more helpful than Gaze, with Arrow ranked marginally more helpful than Gaze.

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- ARHMD technology can significantly improve user understandings of robot intent and increase objective task efficiency.
