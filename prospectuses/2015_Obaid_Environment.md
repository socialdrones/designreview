### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How can a drone be used to detect waste in the environment and motivate a passing pedestrian to throw the trash in the nearest waste bin?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. An online survey with 82 participants viewing 3 videos of different interaction design concepts using audio, visual, and audio+visual cues produced by the drone

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

PArrot AR Drone 2 (on video)

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- The audio+visual design was rated to be significantly more "sensible" than the audio-only design.
- Female participants rated all designs to be more "friendly" compared to males.
- Participants from developing countries rated all designs to be more "persuasive", "pleasant," "sensible," and "compliance"-inducing, compared to participants from developed countries.
- Participants indicated a desire for more functionality, e.g. categorizing trash and directing it to the correct recycle bin; the drone picking up trash on its own.
- Gamification of trash collection assisted by a drone was identified as a possible design direction.
- The presence of drones in public places was speculated as a negative, since it adds to the complexity of the environment.
- Positive feedback in the event of compliance was suggested as a design feature.
- Colors in the visual feedback were suggested by participants as a design dimension.
- Participants expressed some discontent with "being told what to do by a drone," even though overall quantitative results were positive.
- Participants voiced concern over safety and privacy issues with having drones in public spaces, and suggested warning signs in drone-harboring areas.

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Mutimodal interaction (audio+visual) with a drone was found to be more effective and "sensible" than audio-only and visual-only modalities.
- Acceptance and comfort with the concept was found to correlate with cultural and demographic factors, in this case gender and country of origin.
- Mixed and negative sentiments emerged in qualitative comments, while quantitaive results were mixed; in terms of acceptance, comfort, and safety perceptions relating to the proposed design.
- Comments indicated that fully autonomous drones performing chores by themselves are preferable to those trying to persuade humans.
- Perceptions of safety, privacy, acceptance, and overall appeal of autonomous drones directly interacting with humans in public spaces emerged as mixed and negative.
