### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How interaction between humans and drones can be expanded in novel and meaningful ways in home environment?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Online questionnaire with 24 participants
2. Design workshops with 10 participants
3.  virtual reality (VR) with 16 participants

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

- HTC Vive VR headset and 
- Two motion-tracked handheld controllers

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- Participants’ impression of the drone in both sessions (with and without the anthropomorphic features) was positive.
- Nine participants of sixteen (56.3%) favored the drone with anthropomorphistic features.
- Six of the participants reported that the drone with anthropomorphic features gave them the impression that it was a companion, while the others thought it was more like a tool.
- The most prominent tasks that the participants would like the drone companion to do were to bring things (14 participants), clean (13 participants), help in the daily life (13 participants), and give daily updates (10 participants).
- Participants were neutral about the animal like appearance. On how machine-like the drone should be, participants were slightly leaning towards a machine-like appearance. Participants wanted to see some human-like behavior.


### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Overall, participants viewed a drone companion as a tool with social and task-oriented attributes.
- Preferred social role of the drone is as an assistant, butler, toy and device/computer.
- The most preferred tasks that the drone companion would perform were to bring items to the user, clean for the user, give daily updates, cook food and follow around optionally.
- The preferred drone appearance was a round shape and with a face. Other preferred features were arms, eyes and machine like features.
- The preferred interactions are voice control, gesture control, smartphone control, and the drone to be partly autonomous.
