*by JÃ¼rgen Scheible and Markus Funk, in PerDis '16* - [https://doi.org/10.1145/2914920.2940334](https://doi.org/10.1145/2914920.2940334)

### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How effective is a drone-based display, implemented with a projector and a canvas, for indoor deployments, enabling new forms of interactive entertainment and visual experiences?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. A test deployment at a conference banquet with 200 observers.
2. A test deployment at an exhibition opening with 30 observers.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

1. DJI Phantom 2 drone, A3 paper mounted on a stick extending from the drone, Samsung Galaxy Beam phone with 15 ANSI Lumen projector.
2. DJI Phantom 2 drone holding 2mx3m canvas made of a mosquito net, DJI Phantom 2 drone carrying a 300 ANSI Lumen projector.

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies, and how do they inform design?

- Both prototypes were met with positive, "joyful" reactions.
- In outdoor deployments, the apparatus may become unstable in strong wind conditions (largely because of the canvas moving); and can only be used in calm weather.
