*by Daniel Szafir, Bilge Mutlu, and Terrence Fong in HRI '14* - [10.1145/2559636.2559672](https://doi.org/10.1145/2559636.2559672)

### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

- How can flight motions, manipulated via *arcing*, *easing*, and *anticipation* (as defined in the paper), naturally and intuitively communicate drone intent?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Formative, exploratory online (MTurk) survey with 85 participants viewing 3D animated videos of drone flight; with response time, accuracy of drone intent guess, and a composite score of both as measures.
2. Study with 24 participants observing motion of a embodied, colocated drone between targets on a wall.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

Parrot AR Drone.

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- Study 1, *Accuracy*: Although no manipulation significantly improved accuracy over the baseline for any individual primitive, several manipulations led to 100% accuracy rates across a very diverse population.
- Study 1, *Accuracy*: A combination of *easing* and *anticipation* manipulations marginally increased accuracy over baseline motions, demonstrating their potential in accurately expressing intent.
- Study 1, *Composite*: Using both arcing and easing motions when avoiding a person significantly outperformed baseline motions from both egocentric and exocentric perspectives. Further, easing motions marginally outperformed the baseline when departing a person from an egocentric perspective.
- Study 1, *Response Time*: Anticipation significantly lowered composite scores for several primitives; however, as these negative effects were not reflected in the accuracy measure, this is believed to be due to slower response times caused by the increased trajectory lengths from adding anticipatory motions.
- Study 2: Participants correctly perceived the drone's use of arcing, easing, and anticipation.
- Study 2: Participants significantly preferred the flight paths that used the manipulations.
- Study 2: Participants found the manipulated flight paths to be more natural, smooth, elegant, graceful, and intuitive.
- Study 2: Participants felt that the drone using manipulated flight paths is more safe and in control.


### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Smooth velocities may be particularly important when closely interacting with users, for intuitive comprehension of drone intent.
- Arcing may effectively signal that an AFF will not approach or collide with a user or other objects, hance inspiring a perception of safety and stability / being in control.
- Intentful design of flight motions is effective in inspiring positive user sentiment towards using and being with a drone.
