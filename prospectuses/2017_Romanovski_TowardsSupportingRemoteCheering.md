### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How drones can support amateur runners in their endeavours?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Outdoor Live Study with race audience, where feedback via email was collected.
2. Outdoor Live Study with 14 participants (7 runners, 7 supporters) followed by semi-structured interviews with two of the runners and two of the supporters.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

- DJI Phantom 3 
- Drone controls 
- A table displaying the live video feed from the drone

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- Drone made the race experience more exciting than expected.
- Drone helped communicate supporters’ presence during the race to the runner.
- The group of users sharing the drone for the purposes of cheering formed an impromptu cheering community.
- The darkness during the race did not augment the experience of supporters.
- Supporters wanted to follow the runner over extended periods of time.
- Runners noticed the drone and tried to interact with it.


### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Drones offer the potential for providing additional in-race data to runners through projection.
- Supporters see a need for increased means of two-way communication during races.
- Drones could strengthen the personal connection between runners and supporters.
- A future research direction can be how to use drones together with existing remote cheering methods.
