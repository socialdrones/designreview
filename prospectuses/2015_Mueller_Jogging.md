### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

What is it like to jog with a quadcopter?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Outdoor "live" study with 13 participants jogging with a pre-programmed quadcopter in a park.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

Custom-built quadcopter.

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- Elements that support and hinder jogging with a quadcopter as engaging experience:
  - Quadcopter as a pace keeper: Pace keeping
  - Quadcopter as a pace keeper: Peer pressure from the quadcopter
  - Quadcopter as a pace keeper: Finding a way to jog together
  - Quadcopter as a pace keeper: The quadcopter dictating the path.
  - Quadcopter as a pace keeper: Perceived performance improvement.
  - Safety: Safety concerns drawing attention
  - The quadcopter as a companion: Movements caused by wind.
  - The quadcopter as a companion: The quadcopter being in the way.
  - Desire for control: Joggers seeking more, but not complete control over the quadcopter.
  - Quadcopter draws attention: Attention pull of quadcopter affecting the ability to unwind.
  - Quadcopter draws attention: Spectators.
  - Quadcopter draws attention: Distraction from the discomfort of exercise.
  - Quadcopter draws attention: Altitude directing focus.

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- The design space for drones for jogging can be envisioned as consisting of 3 dimensions:
  - Perceived Control
  - Focus an
  - Bodily Interaction.
