### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How might we regulate drone motion to guide pedestrians?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Online Survey with 100 participants.
2. Outdoor Live Study (Field Study) with 10 participants in a park.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

-  DJI Phantom 3 Advanced

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

1. Online Survey
- Constant moving drone (A) was preferred, with 77% of participants commenting on the positive side for its clarity and 75% for its practicality.
- Participants rated the drone flying across the street and waiting (C) highest in terms of practicality and clarity.
2. Live Study
- The turn a corner (B) gesture was universally understood. 
- When the drone tilted strongly left several times all participants understood it meant turn left.
- Participants had different interpretations for the turn a corner (C) gesture, where the
drone rotated clockwise around its vertical axis. 
- The straight-ahead gestures were both understood by all participants, but with some difference in interpretation.
- When the drone maintained a short distance in front of the pedestrian, 9/10 participant understood it as “follow me mode”. 
- The straight ahead (C) gesture, which 8/10 understood to mean “Go faster”, made some  participants feel unsafe (3/10) or lacking control (3/10). 
- The cross a road (C) gesture, was almost universally misunderstood.
- Participants’ preferred distance from the drone, ascertained by flying the drone according to the participants’ wishes, was 4.0 m. Preferred flying height for the drone was 2.6 m (SD = 0.8 m). 
- The drone’s loud noise was commented negatively by 7/10 participants.


### 5) How do the results inform design?

- For straight ahead navigation, the drone should maintain a distance of approximately 3 - 4 m in front of the pedestrian and move at normal walking speed.
- For indicating the need to turn a corner, both studies delivered a strong preference for a tilting gesture, rapidly towards the direction of the turn and returning more slowly to horizontal.
- Drone motion for cases where the drone is required, e.g. due to environmental circumstances, to move further away from the pedestrian was found to be challenging gestures for such cases will require further study.
