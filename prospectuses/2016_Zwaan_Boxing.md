### 1) What are the core research questions investigatedthrough empirical studies?

How can drones be integrated into the context of sports, boxing in particular?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Wizard of Oz study comparing boxing against a drone in a specially designed sparring exercise, and boxing against a human sparring partner.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

Parrot AR Drone 2.0

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- No statistically significant difference was observed between boxing against a drone and boxing against a human, in terms of the dimensions of "enjoyability" and "performance."
- The drone was perceived to be slower and less dynamic than a human sparring partner, which decreased the intensity of exercise.
- Boxers sparring against a human partner exhibited better defensive technique.
- Human sparring partners provided feedback and motivation during the exercise, which was lacking in the drone.

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Current commercial drones do not appear to be as agile, responsive, and effective as a human partner in functioning as an intensive training and practice aid for boxing.
- Users do enjoy the concept of a drone as an exercise aid, and interaction designs involving drones could be used for exercises in which no or minimum impact is required.
