### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

What kinds of gestures can be employed to intuitively command a drone?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. WoZ elicitation study with 25 participants.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

Parrot AR Drone 2.0

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- "Dynamic" gestures were preferred over "static" ones for almost all commands.
- Gestures of a "deictic" nature were often preferred for navigational commands, while "emblematic" and "metaphoric" gestures were preferred for "take picture" and "record video" commands.

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- A reasonably high level of agreement exists between people in terms of which gestures feel intutive for issuing various navigational  or movement commands to a drone.
- There is more variance between people in terms of which gestures feel intuitive for commands like "take picture" or "record video."
