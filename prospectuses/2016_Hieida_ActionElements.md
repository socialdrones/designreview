### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

What are the essential action elements for effective communication of robot emotion from the flying motions of the robot to a human?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. In a design study, 8 designers were recruited to design robot motion videos, which were subsequently shown to 12 evaluators who filled in questionnaires after viewing the designs.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

Parrot "Rolling Spider."

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- *Pleasure–displeasure* and *arousal–sleepy* comprise action elements in the gravitational directions. 
- *Powerful–delicate*, *pinpointing–flexible*, and *hasty–leisurely* comprise action elements in the gravitational and personal directions.

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Sentiments of *pleasure–displeasure* and *arousal–sleepy* can be conveyed through movements in the "gravitational" direction.
- Sentiments of *powerful–delicate*, *pinpointing–flexible*, and *hasty–leisurely* can be conveyed through movements in both "gravitational" and "personal" directions.
