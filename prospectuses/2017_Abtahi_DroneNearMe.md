### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

- How does users naturally interact with drones? 
- Do users choose to touch safe-to-touch drones?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Wizard of Oz study with 24 participants performing tasks on safe-to-touch and unsafe to-touch drones.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

- Two Parrot AR Drones. Safe-to-touch one additionally had a light-weight wooden frame and polypropylene mesh.

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- In the safe-to-touch condition, 39% of interactions were touch-based, gesture was the most common modality.
- Participants in the safe-to-touch condition used touch-based interactions significantly more and gestures significantly less. There was no significant difference in the percentage of use for sound.
- In safe-to-touch condition, 58% of participants used touch as a means of interacting with the safe-to-touch drone. 92% of participants in the safe-to-touch condition indicated that they would feel comfortable touching the drone.
- The participants in the control condition found interacting with the drone significantly more mentally demanding.
- The minimum distance between the participants and the safe-to-touch drone was less than the minimum distance in the control condition. In the safe-to-touch condition all participants interacted with the drone in their intimate space (< 1. 5ft) , compared to 42% in the control condition.
- On a 5-point Likert scale, 83% of participants in the safe-to-touch condition and 42% in the control condition indicated that they felt safe when interacting with the drone.


### 5) How do the results inform design?

- In safe-to-touch condition, 58% of participants touched the drone and 39% of all interactions were touch-based. 
- Interacting with the safe-to-touch drone was reported to be significantly less mentally demanding than the unsafe drone.
- Majority of users (83%) reported that they felt safe while interacting with it.
