### 1) What are the core research questions investigatedthrough empirical studies?

What characteristics should a "drone as an artificial companion" have?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Unstructured interviews, with 10 participants.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

None.

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies, and how do they inform design?

- Participants were generally positive towards using a drone as a companion, provided that they see some specific utilitarian (e.g. running errands, showing information) or hedonic value (e.g. gaming). Most participants would prefer a drone with a number of functions, instead of just one.
- Proposed applications with utilitarian value capitalized on the drone's ability to fly; e.g. transportation of objects, navigation, surveillance, air freshening, and filming.
- The drone was envisioned in various social roles, clustered as "servant," "pet," "friend," and "bully;" which varied (in a decreasing fashion, respectively) on a principal design dimension identified as "perceived controllability." Participants were more appealed to by a drone that has the ability to fulfill multiple roles, rather than one; but higher preference was expressed for roles with higher perceived controllability.
- Participants expressed preference towards an ability to "train" the drone (e.g. as one would a pet), rather than having direct control over it.
- Participants expressed a preference/openness towards slightly unpredictable/playful drone behavior.
- Three solutions are suggested when designing drone as a companion: 
  1. The drone should possess functions that fill up both utilitarian and hedonic value.
  2. Moderate and situationally adaptable level of controllability over the drone is preferred, rather than full autonomy or full control.
  3. "Tolerable" predictability of the drone is preferred, but not full or little predictability.
