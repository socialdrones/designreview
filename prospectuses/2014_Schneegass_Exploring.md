- Drawbacks: Lack of stability
- Preferred: While walking, swimming etc.; not while biking or driving

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed
- Battery life must be considered
- Preferred while walking, standing, swimming; not while biking, driving
- Proposed use cases
