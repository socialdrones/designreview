### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How effective is a drone, equipped with a light-weight flat object and generating force using its own airflow, in realizing a "non-grounded" "encountered-type" haptic display for use with virtual environments?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. WoZ study with 5 participants investigating if users can stably draw a straight line in midair, assisted by the design.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

Parrot AR Drone 2.0, virtual environment implemented in Unity on an Oculus Rift headset, marker-based motion capture system.

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- The haptic display was helpful (in a statistically significant manner) in assisting users to draw a straight line mid-air.

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Drones have potential in being used for implementations of haptic feedback mechanisms for virtual reality, with advantages over static/grounded haptic feedback mechanisms.
