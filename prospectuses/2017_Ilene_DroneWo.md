### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How does the collectivist culture of Chinese people affect how they interact with personal drones?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Wizard of Oz Study with 16 participants on a university campus.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

- DJI Phantom 2

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- During all parts of the study, Chinese participants tended to combine sound with gesture more than the US participants.
- US participants seemed to switch from primarily using gestures to using sound more (Part 2), while Chinese participants increased use of multi-modal inputs during Part 2 (and thus all modalities).
- It is evident that within cultures, agreement scores tended to be relatively high.
- Across cultures, very few of these highly agreed upon interactions match.


### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Support should be designed for multi-modal interaction allowing use of slight variation in gestures, and extra contextual words.
- When Chinese participants used multi-modal interaction, the sound would often (75%) align in meaning with the gestural interaction (i.e., palm out, “stop”). For the other 25% of multi-modal interactions, the sound augmented the gesture used to convey the task.
- There were cultural agreement for the tasks “come closer”, “take a picture” and “go sideways”
- There were cultural disagreement for the tasks “stop”,”fly higher”
- It is important to avoid ambiguity. The addition of voice could also aid in clarifying intention.
- Both Chinese and US participants were likely to compare the interactions with the drone to those with people.
- Chinese participants were less likely than US ones to think of the drone as a pet
- Participants in China allowed the drone to be extremely close,
- Chinese participants overall felt interacting with the drone was more physically demanding
- Chinese participants showed relational behaviours like waving or encouraging the drone.
