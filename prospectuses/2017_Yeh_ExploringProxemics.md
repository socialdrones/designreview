### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How might we design a socially acceptable drone?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Design Study (Drawing Session) with 20 participants where users drew their vision of social drone hovering over a crowd. 
2. Focus group with 5 participants to understand popular attributes that would benefit a social drone.
3. Live Study (Part A) with 16 participants where four conditions were tested, social/non-social and greeting voice/no voice.
4. Live Study (Part B) with 6 participants where the drone had 6 initial positions and only the social shaped drone was used without a greeting voice.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

- A drone with a non-social safety guard
- A drone with a social safety guard (A cage with a tablet attached)

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

1. Part A:
- The average distance with social shape is found to be m=1.06m, sd=0.61 with greeting voice, and m=1.14m, sd=0.57 with no voice.
- The average distance with social shape is found to be m=1.33m, sd=0.55 with greeting voice, and m=1.38m, sd=0.61 with no voice.
- On average, the personal space of social drone with greeting voice is reduced by 30% when compared to nonsocial drone without greeting voice.
2. Part B:
- In terms of change in lateral distance at the height of 1.20 m, increased lateral distance gradually decreased the distance between the social drone and human.


### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Safety regarding drones is a major concern, but users prefer a medium size of a social drone due to visibility. 
- Noise of the drone added to the mental stress of any human in the vicinity of the drone.
- The social drone performed significantly better in closing the distance than what the nonsocial drone could do.
- An average personal space of the social drone and human was closer when compared with the personal space between human and human.
