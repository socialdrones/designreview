### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

What is the impact of simulating emotional states in robots, and its potential during interaction?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Indoor Live Study with 30 participants

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

- 3D Printed sUAV robot

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- The two expressions Mov1 and Mov2, showed subjectsâ€™ tendency to generate positive emotions: Mov1 (Happiness and surprise) and Mov2 (Surprise). 
- Expressions that included propeller noise (Mov3 and Mov4) tended to generate negative emotions: Mov3 (fear, anger, and happiness) and Mov4 (fear and anger).
- The first experiments with white eyes tended to generate happiness 43.3 % and surprise 40 % in subjects. However, the fourth expression (with red eyes) had a higher impact in subjects. 50 % perceived fear, and 80 % selected anger as the emotional state of the robot.

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Movements without propeller noise tended to generate positive emotions, while movements with operating propellers evoked the opposite.
- Human-robot interaction can be improved by giving the robot the faculty to perform different emotional states through a communication interface.
- Subjects were not always consistent for each interpretation that comprehended head movements and eye color.
