### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How can people use semi-autonomous drones for video conferencing?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. An observational field study with 8 participants, where a drone autonomously follows a "field participant" (FP) outdoors, while a "desktop participant" (DP) communicates with them from a remote location. Together the participants work to accomplish 2 tasks.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

Parrot Bebop drone, GPS positioning, smartphone.

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies, and how do they inform design?

- The experience was positive and enjoyable for the DPs.
- The height of the drone and lack of resolution in its camera made it challenging for DPs to observe details in the scene.
- The two participants had difficulty in communicating precise navigational cues due to the lack of a shared frame of reference.
- Lack of extensive control over the drone's positioning was frustrating to some DPs.
- FPs were genrally comfortable around the drone, but some reported discomfort with propeller noise.
- FPs were challenged by the responsibility and concern related to making sure that the autonomous following drone flies properly and sees what they want it to see.
- The drone was utilized as a shared resource between the two participants, requiring constant communication, attention, and behavior change in order to cooperate properly.
- The problem of having multiple reference frames in this application was an essential challenge, and adequately handling it is predicated on technical as well as design domains.
- Rather than fully autonomous, algorithmic control of the drone's flight, in scenarios like the one investigated, the option to override autonomous control and pilot the drone remotely could be beneficial, but adds significant complexity to the design, which warrants further investigation.
- Both parties must be fully considered when designing interactions with and behavior of an autonomous drone that is meant to serve as a shared resource. (In this case, the design focused on the DPs' experience.)
- Having an elevated view over the scene while collaborating with an on-the-ground person is a concept which was well-accepted by participants, who suggested numerous other applications for the concept.
- Participants were concerned about the lack of explicit safety warnings and protocols.
