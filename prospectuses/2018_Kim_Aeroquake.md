*by Heesoon Kim, James A. Landay, in DIS '18* - [10.1145/3196709.3196798](https://doi.org/10.1145/3196709.3196798)

### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How might we create an augmented dance system that uses microphones to enhance a dancer’s body movement with sound and control the movement of drones in real-time?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. A live study in a dancehall, with one dancer participant. 
2. A survey with 10 participants from the audience.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

- Wearable microphones
- Multiple drones
- A laptop PC
- An audio interface with 
- A low latency audio Bluetooth receiver 
- Speaker

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- All participants were aware that the dancer’s movement affected the motion of the drones.
- The average answer for how engaging the dance was 7 (1-not at all engaging to 10-extremely engaging).
- Aeroquake holded the attention of 80% of the participants most of the time or the entire time. 

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Aeroquake satisfied the design principles for technology-augmented dance.
