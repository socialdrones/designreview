### 1) What are the designable factors that make a drone a more social friendly robot?

How ARHMD technology might mediate collocated human-robot interaction by providing feedback on robot motion intent?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Wizard of Oz with 4 participants in a simulated domestic environment. (This was followed by a card sorting session and a focus group)

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

- Parrot AR Drone 

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- There were significant number of post-it-notes wrote “unpredictable” or “unstable” that shows the negative impression of users about drones.
- Participants described a drone’s flying behaviors as a reflection of the drone’s emotional status (e.g. angry, nervous and fierce).
- Participants made interpretations of social roles regarding drone’s appearance and behavior.


### 5) How do the results inform design?

- A drone needs to show its intention to make the interaction comfortable and secure
- Leave enough spaces and give enough controls to users when design the HDI procedure.
- Try to generate a friendlier appearance for drone.
