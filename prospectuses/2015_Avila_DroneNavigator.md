*by Mauro Avila, Markus Funk, and Niels Henze in ASSETS '15* - [10.1145/2700648.2811362](https://doi.org/10.1145/2700648.2811362)

### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How can small, lightweight drones help visually impaired persons find their way and locate objects?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Indoor WoZ study with drone guiding one blind participant in an empty room on a specific path.
2. Indoor WoZ study with drone guiding one blind participant in a populated room to a 50cm-wide target seating area.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

Cheerson CX-10 nano quadcopter

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- The small drone was able to guide the blind participant precisely on paths with straight lines and turns.
- The small drone was able to guide the blind participant precisely in a populated room with its sound only, even in a populated and noisy environment.

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Drones are a feasible way to assist the visually impaired in navigation and object-finding.
- The sound of the drone's propellers itself is sufficient to locate the drone in the absence of sight, with a precision that allows for targets as small as 50cm.
