### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How does leashed quadcopter navigation, free-floating quadcopter navigation, and traditional audio navigation compare for assisting visually impaired people?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. WoZ study with 14 visually impaired participants following three indoor navigation routes of approximately 60m, including staircases and doors, as well as reverberant and dull-sounding environments.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

1. Eachine M8 Mini quadcopter
1. Eachine M8 Mini quadcopter and leash
1. Bone conduction headphones transmitting navigation instructions controlled by a Soundboard app

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- Task completion time was fastest with the free-flying quadcopter, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the audio. Task completion time with the free-flying quadcopter was significantly faster than with the audio navigation.
- Audio navigation led to the most navigation errors, followed by the free-flying quadcopter. The leashed quadcopter led to the least errors. Differences were statistically signifiant.
- Audio navigation was perceived to be inducing the least workload, followed by the leashed quadcopter, then the free-flying quadcopter. However, these differences were not statistically significant.
- Most participants preferred to use audio navigation, followed by the free-flying drone, then the leashed drone.
- The quadcopter was considered advantageous since it does not encumber the user.
- Confidence in quadcopter navigation was not high, since it may be difficult to perceive it in noisy environments, and the noise became annoying to participants after a while.
- The leashed quadcopter was accepted as a precise navigation tool, but was not preferred since it encumbers both hands (one with the leash, while one is readily holding a cane).

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Despite leading to better task performance and various ergonomic advantages, acceptance of drones as a navigational aid was not higher than the technically "worse" solution (audio); due to a lack of confidence in the technology in diverse environments, noise characteristics, and concerns over social acceptance.
