### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How might we improve navigation experience by navigating users with projected in-situ instructions?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

Outdoor Wizard of Oz study with 16 participants.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

- Quadcopter-mounted projector

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- There was no significant effect between the two navigation systems considering the RTLX score.
- In-situ navigation instructions provided by the levitating quadcopter were leading to a significantly shorter distance compared to the smartphone-based navigation instructions.
- Participants required considerably more time to complete a route using in-situ navigation instructions using a levitating projector. 
- Participants could memorize points of interest significantly more accurately using in-situ instructions.


### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Using in-situ navigation instructions while walking leads to a higher memorability of the surroundings as opposed to mobile phone navigation, but it requires more time.
