*by Judith Uchidiuno, Justin D. Weisz, Justin Manweiler, in CHI '18* - [10.1145/3170427.3188457](https://doi.org/10.1145/3170427.3188457)

### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

What are the effects of contextual factors on peopleâ€™s feelings of privacy violation, and the mitigating effects of a privacy-preserving technology?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Online Survey with 7200 participants.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

- 

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- Many respondents felt that the operator of the drone, the owner of the drone, and they themselves were responsible for protecting their privacy
- Roughly half of the respondents felt that their privacy was violated no matter who owned the drone.
- Feelings of privacy violation significantly improved after a presentation of a technological intervention.


### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Privacy-preserving technologies can reduce privacy-related drone fears. 
- Technologies that prevent the capture of data in sensitive situations had the greatest impact, and technologies that allow individuals to query a drone for its owner, purpose, and data being collected also helped significantly.
