### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How can we better understand the metaphors and relationships that occur when users interact with drones?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. WoZ elicitation study with 19 participants

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

DJI Phantom 2.

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies, and how do they inform design?

- Participants largely preferred to interact with the drone through gestures alone, then with voice, and then with a combination of gesture and voice (in tandem or in sequence). (A small number of prop-based interactions was discarded from analysis.)
- Many participants initially expressed discomfort in talking with a drone, but grew used to it over time.
- Gestures were preferred as they are quick and allow for precise adjustments and continuous control.
- Repeated waving/sweeping was preferred for navigating the drone when far from the body, while smaller motions with body parts as reference were preferred within body range.
- Framing and "invisible camera" gestures were preferred with high agreement for photo-taking, as well as commands involving the word "picture."
- Feelings of naturalness, safety, perceived control over the drone were rated highly, while the interactions were not considered to be physical and mentaly demanding.
- Indications ofr when the drone is listening/receiving commands were noted as a desirable feature.
- "Interacting with a person" and "interacting with a pet" were observed as preferred high-level design metaphors.
- Noise and airflow around the drone led to discomfort.
