### 1) What are the core research questions investigatedthrough empirical studies?

Can visually impaired people localize and follow a consumer-grade drone ona a running track?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

A WoZ study with 2 visually impaired participants performing localization and navigation tasks following a drone outdoors, on a running track.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

Parrot Bebop drone, helmet-mounted camera.

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- Blind invididuals can accurately localize a drone by the sound of its propellers.
- Participants felt comfortable and confidents in their ability to localize and follow the drone at a walking pace, and executed the tasks successfully.
- Participants were not confident in their ability to localize and follow the drone at a running pace, and in the drone's ability in assisting them in physical exercise.
- Results did not change when the distance between the drone and the participant was changed between 3m and 4m.

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- It may be feasible to use drones for tasks involving localization and nagivation at a slow pace, by the sound of the drone alone, without relying on sight.
- At a high pace, when running or undertaking physical exercise of intensity, it is not feasible to expect people to follow or localize a drone by sound alone, without sight.
