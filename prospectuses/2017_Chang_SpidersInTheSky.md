### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How do users feel drones affect their personal privacy and security expectations?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Indoor Live Study with a real drone and a model drone with 20 participants.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

- Parrot A.R.Drone 
- A model Drone
- An Ipad

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- When asked about drones in relation to privacy and security, participants, more than half of all participants (11/20) mentioned the feeling of being watched around a drone.
- 80% of our participants mentioned a concern for the potential to be recorded either in public or in their own homes through a window.
- The majority of participants (15/20) worried about physical harm or death because of drones malfunctioning and falling out of the sky 
- A large portion of participants (12/20) also worried about the drone’s capability to carry unknown items.
- Over half of our participants (11/20) were concerned with damage and interference with air traffic. 
- All of the participants’ were concerned about drones disturbing nature. 
- All of the drone group participants had a negative reaction to the sound that the drone made. 
- Seven drone group participants commented negatively on the breeze that they felt from the drone while in flight. 
- After seeing a drone for the first time in the experiment, the majority of drone group participants (8/10) were surprised it was made of soft materials and that it had a guard around it. 
- Movements of a drone can significantly impact participants’ concerns about their physical safety and about drones invading private space. 


### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Geo-fencing could be used to prevent drones from getting too close to places such as schools, government buildings, landmarks, or wildlife areas. 
- One possibility for future work would be to explore how drones could operate in designated spaces or drone “highways”. 
- Drone designs should explore the use of non-visual cues and recording feedback to enhance users’ privacy and security. 
- We suggest that drone designers carefully consider the use of colors, logos, and decorations to make drones “friendly”, or “unfriendly” in cases where it is necessary for people to keep their distance from certain drones. 
- Drone sizes could be balanced to ensure that they are not perceived as too stealthy or concealing dangerous items. 
- To help protect wildlife, we also suggest that drones could be designed with visual or audio animal repellents.
