### 1) What are the core research questions investigated through empirical studies?

How will users interact with the drone-projected maps?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Indoor Lab Study with 16 participants without a drone
2. Outdoor Live Study with 13 participants 

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

1. Indoor Study
- A projector (LG PF80G)
- Optitrack tracking system
- Phone (Samsung Galaxy Zoom K)

2. Outdoor Study
- 3DR Solo drone was fitted with a laser projector (Celluon PicoPro), and 
- A depth camera (Structure Sensor) connected to an iPod Touch
- An Android phone (Google Nexus 6P)

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

1. Indoor Study:
- There was no significant difference between using mobile phone vs. drone projected map for navigation tasks, in terms of effectiveness (success rate) and efficiency. 
- Spatial technique is beneficial for spatial learning, but it requires significantly more physical effort.

2. Outdoor Study
- The most common challenge participants had was in keeping track of the cursor position due to the jitter of the drone.
- Participants felt engaged, even while watching other participants use the system.
- Used as is (without a named leader), participants thought the system could support groups from 3 to 20 users at a time.
- The average safety score of the interface was 3.7 out of 5 being the safest.
- Most desired a positioning of the drone slightly in front of themselves, instead of overhead.
- Participants desired to have the ability to use voice communication, both for
input and output.


### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Spatial technique enabled remembering more POIs correctly, but it required more physical demand.
- For drone-based maps, all the visual information should be integrated into a single display (the projection).
- The system should recognize gestures from different users, allowing people to interact together in groups.
