*by Wai Shan (Florence) Ng and Ehud Sharlin, in RO-MAN 2011* - [10.1109/ROMAN.2011.6005280](https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2011.6005280)

### 1) What are the core research questions investigatedthrough empirical studies?

User sentiment towards gesture-based high-level drone control using a designed gesture vocabulary for the tasks *takeoff/land*, *raise/lower*, *hover* (*stop/come/circle*), and *find*.

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Design study with 3 participants imagining gesturing to a drone.
2. Informed WoZ study with 2 participants - one adult and one child

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

Parrot AR Drone.

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- Much disagreement between participants as to the nature and parameters (size of motion, speed…) of natural/intuitive gestures
- Using large gestures as the sole interaction modality quickly leads to fatigue
- People speak to the drone while gesturing, even though not instructed to do so; addressing it like a pet, even “show concern for its wellbeing” 
- People instinctively recruit both arms or perform gestures larger/faster to demand a task to be performed faster or more powerfully
- Using a prop (a raquet) is not preferred, compared to free-hand gesturing

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Using gestures is more natural and less cognitively demanding for casual/novice users, compared to using a controller which demands attention switching between drone and controller
- Using gestures to control a drone can be used to induce attachment / socialization, as if it were a pet
- Free hand gestures are preferred over those involving props
- Gesture + voice is preferred over gesture alone
- Gesture speed/magnitude is expected to correlate with drone behavior
