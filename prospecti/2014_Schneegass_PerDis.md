*by Stefan Schneegass, Florian Alt, Jürgen Scheible, and Albrecht Schmidt in PerDis '14* - [10.1145/2611009.2611013](https://doi.org/10.1145/2611009.2611013)

### (1) What are the core research questions investigatedthrough empirical studies?

How readable are mid-air displays?

### (2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

1. Outdoor WoZ study using Snellen charts with 12 participants, post questionnaires and interviews.

### (3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

Custom octocopter, iPad.

### (4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- Readability is significantly worse when participant is walking
- No significant difference between readability in stationary, hovering, flying conditions
- Proposed use cases: Emergency, advertisement, group displays, entertainment, notifications, hands-occupied cases like swimming/skiing; group use more likely than individual
- Flight stability is not enough, causes “stress”

### (5) How do the results inform design?

- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed
- Use cases should not involve moving user, but drone could move
- Proposed use cases
