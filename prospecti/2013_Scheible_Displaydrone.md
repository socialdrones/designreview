*by Jürgen Scheible, Achin Hoth, Julian Saal, and Haifeng Su, in PerDis '13* - [10.1145/2491568.2491580](https://doi.org/10.1145/2491568.2491580)

### 1) What are the core research questions investigatedthrough empirical studies?

How is a drone-mounted projector perceived by a group audience?

### 2) What empirical methods have been used to study the research questions?

WoZ study, outdoor, with 40 spectators interacting through SMS messages. Interviews with 14 of the spectators.

### 3) What kind of drone and/or other apparatus was used?

Custom octocopter, picoprojector, smartphone.

### 4) What results have been obtained from the studies?

- Novelty value
- Noise of the drone noticed before visuals on wall
- Battery life short (around 15 min)
- Proposed use cases: advertising, gaming

### 5) How do the results inform design?

- Stable and robust hovering (position control) is needed
- Battery life must be considered
- Projector considerations: darkness, distance
- Very attention-grabbing: as a flying object, noise source, and light source
- Drone can be “costumed” (as UFO, DeLorean…) to imply interaction affordances
- Moving / subject following drone creates novel affordances for content (e.g. running shoe ad)
