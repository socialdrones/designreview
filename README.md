# Consolidating Empirical Research Findings on Social Drone Design

The material in this repository accompanies our research paper on "The Design of Social Drones" submitted to the 2019 edition of ACM's [CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems](https://sigchi.org/conferences/conference-history/chi/), where we aimed to consolidate the state of the art in design knowledge for autonomous flyers in inhabited environments.

## What are social drones?

We propose the term *social drones* to describe **fully autonomous, free-flying embodied agents operating in environments co-populated by humans**, who may be interacting with the agent directly or merely present as bystanders.

Social drones - and more generally, social robots - unavoidably communicate with humans. This communication can be active and involve conveying a specific message, but it may also be passive and minimal---even the existence of a drone in the environment can convey things to humans. This can be thought of as analogous to co-located existence of humans, where some form of social interaction is inevitable, even when humans are not communicating explicitly with each other. Similarly, social drones can be said to constantly operate in the context of social interactions with humans.

## Contents

### [Prospectuses for Empirical Research Papers on Social Drone Design](prospectuses)

Research papers presenting empirical design studies on social drones have been initially characterized by producing "prospectuses" based on 5 key questions.

### [Design Concerns for Social Drones](design-concerns)

Findings from research papers were clustered based on an emergent framework relating *human-centered concerns* and *product design concerns*, which allows us to consolidate and compare design knowledge created through different studies. 

## Contributing

Our intention is for this repository to serve as a living resource, as well as a meeting point, for a whole community of researchers and designers dealing with social drones. We welcome corrections, additions, suggestions, and discussions.

Any pull requeests with modifications to the content, as well as any suggestions or questions submitted through [issues](https://github.com/socialdrones/designreview/issues) will be duly reviewed and responded to.
