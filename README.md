# Review: Human Factors in Social Drones

The material in this repository is intended to accompany our research paper on "Human Factors in Social Drones," submitted to the 2019 edition of ACM's CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, where we aim to consolidate the state of the art in design knowledge for autonomous flyers in inhabited environments.

## What are social drones?

We propose the term *social drones* to describe fully autonomous, free-flying embodied agents operating in environments co-populated by humans, who may be interacting with the agent directly or merely present as bystanders.

Social drones - and more generally, social robots - unavoidably communicate with humans. This communication can be active and involve conveying a specific message, but it may also be passive and minimal---even the existence of a drone in the environment can convey things to humans. This can be thought of as analogous to co-located existence of humans, where some form of social interaction is inevitable, even when humans are not communicating explicitly with each other. Similarly, social drones can be said to constantly operate in the context of social interaction with humans.
