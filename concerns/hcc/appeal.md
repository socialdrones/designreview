# Appeal

Are people willing to accept, acquire, and/or use a drone ordrones, as designed, for the purpose under investigation?Do people feel psychologically comfortable and safe ininteracting with the drone(s) or simply cohabiting thesame environment? Do they have confidence that the dronewill not inflict damage or otherwise misbehave?

2. Scheible et al. 2013
- Very attention-grabbing: as a flying object, noise source, and light source
- Drone can be “costumed” (as UFO, DeLorean…) to imply interaction affordances
- Moving / subject following drone creates novel affordances for content (e.g. running shoe ad)

3. Arroyo et al. 2014
- Movements without propeller noise tended to generate positive emotions, while movements with operating propellers evoked the opposite.

4. Schneegass et al. 2014a
- Preferred: While walking, swimming etc.; not while biking or driving
- Proposed use cases: Emergency, advertisement, group displays, entertainment, notifications, hands-occupied cases like swimming/skiing; group use more likely than individual

5. Schneegass et al. 2014b
- Flight stability is not enough, causes “stress”

6. Szafir, Mutlu, and Fong 2014
- Participants felt that the drone using manipulated flight paths is more safe and in control. Intentful design of flight motions is effective in inspiring positive user sentiment towards using and being with a drone.
- Intentful design of flight motions is effective in inspiring positive user sentiment towards using and being with a drone.

7. Cauchard et al. 2015
- Participants largely preferred to interact with the drone through gestures alone, then with voice, and then with a combination of gesture and voice (in tandem or in sequence). (A small number of prop-based interactions was discarded from analysis.)
- Feelings of naturalness, safety, perceived control over the drone were rated highly, while the interactions were not considered to be physical and mentaly demanding.
- Indications ofr when the drone is listening/receiving commands were noted as a desirable feature.
- "Interacting with a person" and "interacting with a pet" were observed as preferred high-level design metaphors.

- Quadcopter draws attention: Distraction from the discomfort of exercise. Use robot to direct focus away from discomfort of exercise

10. Obaid et al. 2015
- The presence of drones in public places was speculated as a negative, since it adds to the complexity of the environment.
- Participants expressed some discontent with "being told what to do by a drone," even though overall quantitative results were positive.
- Participants voiced concern over safety and privacy issues with having drones in public spaces, and suggested warning signs in drone-harboring areas.
- Acceptance and comfort with the concept was found to correlate with cultural and demographic factors, in this case gender and country of origin.
- Mixed and negative sentiments emerged in qualitative comments, while quantitaive results were mixed; in terms of acceptance, comfort, and safety perceptions relating to the proposed design.
- Perceptions of safety, privacy, acceptance, and overall appeal of autonomous drones directly interacting with humans in public spaces emerged as mixed and negative.

11. Al-Zayer et al. 2016
- Participants(Blind) felt comfortable and confidents in their ability to localize and follow the drone at a walking pace, and executed the tasks successfully.
- Participants(Blind) were not confident in their ability to localize and follow the drone at a running pace, and in the drone's ability in assisting them in physical exercise.

12. Cauchard et al. 2016
-

13. Jones et al. 2016
- The experience was positive and enjoyable for the DPs
- FPs were challenged by the responsibility and concern related to making sure that the autonomous following drone flies properly and sees what they want it to see.

- FPs were genrally comfortable around the drone, but some reported discomfort with propeller noise.
- Participants were concerned about the lack of explicit safety warnings and protocols.

14. Kim, Kim, and Kim 2016
- Participants were generally positive towards using a drone as a companion, provided that they see some specific utilitarian (e.g. running errands, showing information) or hedonic value (e.g. gaming). Most participants would prefer a drone with a number of functions, instead of just one.
- Participants expressed a preference/openness towards slightly unpredictable/playful drone behavior.

15. Scheible and Funk 2016
- Both prototypes were met with positive, "joyful" reactions.

16. Zwaan and Barakova 2016
- Users do enjoy the concept of a drone as an exercise aid, and interaction designs involving drones could be used for exercises in which no or minimum impact is required.

17. Abtahi et al. 2017
- Majority of users (83%) reported that they felt safe while interacting with it.

18. Avila Soto et al. 2017
- Despite leading to better task performance and various ergonomic advantages, acceptance of drones as a navigational aid was not higher than the technically "worse" solution (audio); due to a lack of confidence in the technology in diverse environments, noise characteristics, and concerns over social acceptance.

19. Colley et al. 2017
- Constant moving drone (A) was preferred, with 77% of participants commenting on the positive side for its clarity and 75% for its practicality.
- Participants rated the drone flying across the street and waiting (C) highest in terms of practicality and clarity.

20. Chang, Chundury, and Chetty 2017
- When asked about drones in relation to privacy and security, participants, more than half of all participants (11/20) mentioned the feeling of being watched around a drone.
- 80% of our participants mentioned a concern for the potential to be recorded either in public or in their own homes through a window.
- The majority of participants (15/20) worried about physical harm or death because of drones malfunctioning and falling out of the sky
- A large portion of participants (12/20) also worried about the drone’s capability to carry unknown items.
- Over half of our participants (11/20) were concerned with damage and interference with air traffic.
- All of the participants’ were concerned about drones disturbing nature.
- Geo-fencing could be used to prevent drones from getting too close to places such as schools, government buildings, landmarks, or wildlife areas.
- One possibility for future work would be to explore how drones could operate in designated spaces or drone “highways”.
- Drone designs should explore the use of non-visual cues and recording feedback to enhance users’ privacy and security.
- We suggest that drone designers carefully consider the use of colors, logos, and decorations to make drones “friendly”, or “unfriendly” in cases where it is necessary for people to keep their distance from certain drones.
- Drone sizes could be balanced to ensure that they are not perceived as too stealthy or concealing dangerous items.
- To help protect wildlife, we also suggest that drones could be designed with visual or audio animal repellents.

23. Karjalainen 2017
- Participants’ impression of the drone in both sessions (with and without the anthropomorphic features) was positive.
- Overall, participants viewed a drone companion as a tool with social and task-oriented attributes.
- Preferred social role of the drone is as an assistant, butler, toy and device/computer.

- The preferred drone appearance was a round shape and with a face. Other preferred features were arms, eyes and machine like features.
- The preferred interactions are voice control, gesture control, smartphone control, and the drone to be partly autonomous.

24. Yeh et al. 2017
- Safety regarding drones is a major concern, but users prefer a medium size of a social drone due to visibility.
- Noise of the drone added to the mental stress of any human in the vicinity of the drone.
- The social drone performed significantly better in closing the distance than what the nonsocial drone could do.
- An average personal space of the social drone and human was closer when compared with the personal space between human and human.

25. Brock et al. 2018
- Participants felt engaged, even while watching other participants use the system.
- The average safety score of the interface was 3.7 out of 5 being the safest.

26. Han and Bae 2018
- South Korean participants can comfortably enter social space to interact with drones, and hovering drones in eye-level altitude seem to promote this attitude.

27. Khamis et al. 2018
- Proposed Scenarios: audio guide at tourist attractions, worker assistance in large warehouses, market research, disabled assistance, hands-free interaction while doing sports.


28. Jensen, Hansen, and Knoche 2018
- Only two participants felt uncomfortable when approaching the drone, feeling uncomfortable had no significant effect on the preferred acknowledging distance.
- Changes in drone speeds were perceived as potentially threatening, aggressive, or erratic behavior.

29. Kim and Landay 2018

31. Knierim et al. 2018b
-

32. Khamis et al. 2018
- Users should be warned before drones collect data about them.

33. Tan, Lee, and Gao 2018
- There were significant number of post-it-notes wrote “unpredictable” or “unstable” that shows the negative impression of users about drones.
- A drone needs to show its intention to make the interaction comfortable and secure
- Leave enough spaces and give enough controls to users when design the HDI procedure.
- Try to generate a friendlier appearance for drone.

34. Uchidiuno, Weisz, and Manweller 2018
- Many respondents felt that the operator of the drone, the owner of the drone, and they themselves were responsible for protecting their privacy
- Roughly half of the respondents felt that their privacy was violated no matter who owned the drone.
- Feelings of privacy violation significantly improved after a presentation of a technological intervention.
- Privacy-preserving technologies can reduce privacy-related drone fears.
- Technologies that prevent the capture of data in sensitive situations had the greatest impact, and technologies that allow individuals to query a drone for its owner, purpose, and data being collected also helped significantly.

35. Walker et al. 2018
- NavPoints, Arrow, and Gaze, were ranked as significantly more helpful than Utilities. NavPoints was rated as significantly more helpful than Gaze, with Arrow ranked marginally more helpful than Gaze.
